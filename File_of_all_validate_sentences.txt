epod, oh k
Matt|, ahh, didn't see that  :)
HrdwrBoB, I keep getting this: /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-686/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.
it's too late. i'm mounting /bed
=== topyli [~juha@dsl-hkigw3k9b.dial.inet.fi]  has left #ubuntu []
billytwowilly, you have the kernel source or kernel-headers packages?
billytwowilly, you need to install the kernel-headers
Matt|, the record for ad-aware on a customer's pc here is um, 1951 pieces of spyware
epod, hmm my cousins computer only had around 700
I thought I installed those.. I'll take a look again
HrdwrBoB: How amny should i make?
epod, wow, thats a lot of spyware  :(
what is gnome 2.9 like?
Matt|, right now, its very simular to 2.8  ;)
hmm. I have kernel 2.6.8.1 but synaptec wants to install 2.6.7 headers?
|trey|, yep.
billytwowilly, not good
billytwowilly: install linux-headers-2.6.8.1-3-686

billytwowilly, you need the one that corresponds exactly to your kernel
tweaked: just one?
HrdwrBoB: ok extended or primary?
primary
so (i think) -i386, -i686, -k7 etc
HrbwrBoB: ok done and saved
hmm. that's strange. synaptec gives me the wrong ones but on the command line it's all good;)
excellent
ok
Thanks matt
try now
Matt|, bob2 already told him what he needs   ;)
whats the path to the recent commands used in a terminal? or are those only in kde?
|trey|, sorry
billytwowilly: the FAQ explains how to get the proper headers for your kernel installed
HrdwrBob: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/hdb1
traviss: run 'history'
traviss: "history"
tweaked: yes
trans_err, ~/.bash_history
|trey|, i thought it depends on the kernel he is running
thanks
Matt|: it does
Matt|: it does
ah
Matt|: but he's running 2.6.8.1-3-686
so he is using i686?
ah
Matt|, it does... default is -386... but yeah...
must have missed that

mdz, maybe on #mythtv then? your nick is very familiar
billytwowilly: yes, mythtv
hmm. wtf? /bin/sh: line 1: gcc: command not found. I was certain I installed that..
billytwowilly: install build-essential
However... I have in my rep. the install CD as source. Is it possible to have an online rep. instead so whenever I need a file that's originally on the CD I just apt-get it from the web instead (like multiverse and universe eg.)
billytwowilly, not installed by default
bob2, damnit, you type too fast  ;)
hehe
HrdwrBoB: mount: mount point /etc/fstab is not a directory
, that is what it says
no, I knew I needed it so I went and selected it in synaptec
mdz: will mythtv ever go into debian?
strangeness.
synaptec doesn't love me;)
bob2: not likely
mdz: too unstable (code-churn-wise)?
HrdwrBoB: should i make a directory
tweaked: nono, you have to edit the file /etc/fstab :)
yes
bob2: no
=== ogra recognizes the first attendees for the conference on the wiki :))

I use /home/hrdwrbob/storage
but it can be anywher

billytwowilly: the equivalent in ubuntu is to add universe and multiverse
Hmm, is it possible to have Ubuntu's Firefox automagically accept Ubuntu related certificates? would be handy maybe?

hey guys
I just intalled ubuntu
and have only used mandrake before
and already searched but couldn't find the answer
SaintJerome: great move ;)
HrdwrBoB: is it mkdir /home/2nd
Ubuntu is cuter. ;)
how can I mount my windows hardrive do that it is shown in /mnt?
|trey|: file a bug report as a feature request
haha @ arrival "a long time ago" for Brian  :)
tweaked: better off to mkdir /home/yourusername/2nd
because /home is for user directories
but it's up to you
SaintJerome: which device is you windows partition ?
SaintJerome, mount -t ntfs /dev/hdX (where X is your windows drive) /mnt
thanks
HrdwrBoB: ok that is doen what next
with mandrake it just did it
but i'd rather learn anyway
thanks a lot
tweaked: now, add a line to /etc/fstab (using possibly sudo gedit /etc/fstab)
HrdwrBoB, would it be website related, or Firefox related?  :o
|trey|: firefox
SaintJerome, that presumes your windows drive is NTFS, by the way
which it is
ok then :)
HrdwrBoB, thats what I figured, just making sure  :)
HrdwrBoB: sudo: gebit: command not found
gedit
add a line like '/deb/hdb1 /home/myhomedir/2nd   ext3'

stuNNed: everything mountable from fstab is in the "disks" location...mounted with doubleclick
HrdwrBoB, did you already have him edit /etc/fstab? else that wouldn't work...
becuase you already configured that
|trey|: nownow, pay attention
ogra, my ntfs part is mounted but doesn't show up in 'disks'
stuNNed: when you mount it, it should show up

Hi, i Updated to hoary and well firefox is just not working when i click in the icon it says "accesskey="&allowpopups.accesskey;"
tweaked: ok, what was the line you put in /etc/fstab
Golo: nothing in the bts?
HrdwrBoB, ntfs part is mounted (due to needing my documents folder) but not showing up in disks for some reason, is it because it's not really a 'disk' per say?
stuNNed: unmount it
HrdwrBoB: /deb/hdb1 /home/myhomedir/2nd   ext3
what it's bts?
Mmm, running apt-get upgrade is fun

might be something related to amd64 though
Hi guys.  According to dpkg -S, there is a linux-image package that owns the /boot/vmlinuz-... file.  I need to use this package.  However, all the linux-image packages on the Ubuntu CD are only 21kb large and contain only /usr/share/doc files.  Where can I find the full package for a kernel-image?
i'm getting used to that
epod, yes, I noticed, just thought I'd explain it also ;)
the_one, Unix is case sensitive always.
aratdagnir: if you dont have hoary, i guess
i'm trying to turn off some unused services that start at the beginning
i mean the boot
:)
aratdagnir: sysv-rc-conf
that could be the problem....It's a lot easier to change OSes, than to change brain from win to linux. must....reformat....brain....
aratdagnir: or update-rc.d
aratdagnir: or rm
mjr, lol, ok.  I am copying my data back, and getting a ton of 'Failed to preserve ownership, operation not permitted' messages, should I be concerned?
ogra: or maybe g-s-t if you're using hoary
;)
epod, that's probably just because fat doesn't support permissions so they can't be preserved
hmm now a mplayer bug
what a night ;)
epod, the data will probably be fine

Can I add more locales to the gnome weather panel?  Stupid thing doesn't have my city :(
jief, you can just do it for your clients though... if you show people too much, they could eventually take your job for less.... thats bad  :(
jief: subfont.ttf is an internal name mplayer uses... copy any ttf font you like to the path in the errormsg
jief: ahahah 'my website is down'
'can you get to any other sites'
'oh.. no...'
'well then, GTFO'

how do I enable the bytecode interpreter without recompiling?

is the latest wine on hoary now supporting windows program that use installshield installer?

epod, thats true of cdrecord too though, which is what k3b uses...

Gentoo is just absurd, waiting days to compile a whole OS is a bit extreme.
imo :)
|trey|: the only server giving me problem at work is the gentoo one

stuNNed, I wouldn't trust myself to compile critical services... I dunno
stuNNed: i'm thinking of packaging my own server distro soon. based on debian
the_one, I think its off topic...
jief, I have a 3.2 p4 w/ 1gb ram, so it's so a 1% that is so minimal it's not funny
the_one: it's not ubuntu
epod: i installed gentoo on my amd64 for kicks and giggles. it lasted about 2 hours, then i stopped the install hehe
the_one, they are thinking of dropping GNOME entirely... thats just not a good thing imo...
they should go xfce4
the_one: I used slackware 6-7 years ago
the_one: not anymore.
jief, I've wasted 2 weeks of my life to that distro.
jief, Ubuntu is the only distro that's worked well with my hardware, since this is a notebook.  *every* other distro that uses ACPI shuts down when thermal zone loads, but Ubuntu works
<-- wasted twenty minutes on that distro
And I don't think my CPU is melting, so I am assuming it's running.
HrdwrBoB, you hardly missed anything, its still the same old thing...
epod: ubuntu had a lot of work on laptops
can't download screenshot...I click accept and nothing happens..wtf
|trey|: precisely
our devel at work develops OpenNA, a security-oriented server distro
only drawback, it uses rpms
i want to do the same but based on debian
=== stuNNed wishes there was dellbuggybios .deb for his laptop :)  maybe roll my own DSDT is an option.
cardador, can't get your screenshot

|trey|: to replace Symantec Ghost
i had to work on this at work for a client
jief, oh... seems wierd  :o
well, works well
my system can be used to deploy any OS actually
as long as it sports a supported FS
jief, that sounds more useful... GPL?
yeah
i just packaged some already available software together. wrote the how-to
jief, supports mac fs as well?
jief, might check it out then, see what it can help me with  :)

Pass on why they have fuses though.
jief, HFS+ = a bridge between HFS and UFS, due to most tools in Darwin expecting UFS, and most Mac apps expecting HFS... very wierd setup but I guess it works...
jief, ok, might could use that in mac labs here at school, currently using netrestore which is limited to unicast
jief, its funny, one is case sensitive, one isn't... must have been a lot of fun to fix that...

i have a problem re: k3b and am looking for some insight. cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc -audio -pad *.wav works when i have a directory of .wav files. but k3b doesn't work. it lists my CD/RW drive as "writes CDs: no" (though it says it writes cd/rws). any guesses?
problem is, i haven't tried to image a machine with multiple partitions, but that could be done i'm sure
s/$hit/stuff/ sorry
you'd have to write a small bash script to create the partitions first i guess
jief, does it support multicast or unicast or both?
jief, Novell is actually working on something very simular to WinFS as part of iFolder... seems interesting...  :)
Can't for the life of me recall what it was called though... Simian I think maybe?
|trey|: well, i have this promo DVD kit from novell. they have scripts to setup everything, exept LDAP. which bugs me to no end. i never came around to setup all their nice stuff because of that

saves lot of space too
that seems like overkill
as soon as you have 2-3 GUIs running, it tends to slow down

I'll take that as a no

=== ajmitch checks to see if his packages are in hoary/universe
blocke: hmm, that didn't say spindown time :-P. well, sudo hdparm -S 12 /dev/hda does what you want :-).
I did that several minutes ago
In universe there is fluxbox_0.1.14-4_i386.deb and fluxbox_0.9.9-1_i386.deb but i can only manage to apt 0.1.14-4. How can I get the 0.9.9-1 release?
=== blocke reboots in the vein hope that its just a fluke...
great, I have about 10 packages in universe for hoary :)
ud, dpkg ?
umm.. I use apt-get. But should I try dpkg?
ud: 0.9.9 is most likely the hoary version, not the warty version
ud: dpkg won't help you
(well, it could, but it's not advisable)
ahh but its in the the same repo?
=== nomasteryoda is away: IM me @ nomasteryoda on AIM / YIM

Because it wouldnt show the newer release with apt-cache search

hey guys, I just installed Fluxbox, and I"m running it...all the fonts in my gnome apps look kinda gross now
they don't look like they did in gnome
fluxbox is in ubuntu?
dopey: in universe, of course.
that makes more sense
does anyone here have k3b experience? i can record things with cdrecord but k3b won't let me (did k3bsetup and all and it seems happy. but k3b says my device isn't a cd writer)
i thought universe was unsupported though
it is

Nafallo: so go back to 2.6.7?
djtansey: yepp, or upgrade to 2.6.9
hmm progression or regression
Nafallo: thanks. i'll see if ubuntu has 2.6.9 packaged
it will work with the ubuntu kernel
jdub: k3b will?
no, there's no 2.6.9 in warty or hoary
yes
there are plenty of people using it
jdub: never worked with ANY 2.6 for me :-P
jdub: then any guess as to what the problem is?
jdub: that's with both ubuntu and debian kernels.
dunno if there's a FAQ or something on the website, but it would make sense to check
jdub: i did. nothing i could find that was related
opss, typo! 2.6.8* ;-)
jdub: other than some k3bsetup .ICEauthority issues
Nafallo: but it works with 2.6.7 for you?
jdub: k3b and 2.6.8|2.6.8.1 on both my computers with burners fail.
djtansey: yes.
djtansey: and it should be fixed in 2.6.9 also :-)
Nafallo: the ubuntu kernels do not have those bugs.
Nafallo: thanks.
plenty of other people are using k3b with ubuntu
jdub: how come when I TRIED with ubuntu k3b couldn't see my burner?
jdub: same thing with my girlfriend.
i don't know your particular circumstances
i can only relate what i know
it just doesn't work :-)
jdub: same here.
that may be true in your case
but it is not the case for many other users
jdub: maybe it's just drive specific?
i don't know
jdub: but then, I got both a samsung and a toshiba ;-).
=== logic is now known as logic|away
it might be that I'm running my cd-rws as ide-cd :-)

Hi! Just installed Ubuntu to my hard disk. The sound is not working. Funny thing is it worked from the Live CD. I mucked around a bit haplessly. I don't know much of how the sound internals work.

Sound works from Windows partition.

=== Hylas [~Hylas@dialup-96.163.220.203.acc01-gurw-wag.comindico.com.au]  has joined #ubuntu
which?
ekCo, Run 'synaptic' and find the program with the problem.  Look at it's depends and recommends, etc, and see if you can find a recommended or suggested package within the transitive closure of the union of depends, recommends, and suggests for the package that installs locales.
thanks bob2. i am running through to config now

ekCo, I'm not certain if my answer is correct.  I never use Qt applications, and have not seen that before.
hmm ok
I had a question about .deb files
Locales probably means language translation files...  but it could be something else.  You should ask on #kubuntu.
=== tiglionabbit [~nick@c-67-171-159-205.hsd1.or.comcast.net]  has joined #ubuntu
why not make them 'install' when double clicked
with prompts in between ofcourse
... since it's a Qt application; Qt is the user interface widget toolkit used by KDE programs.
ok.. wheres the depends and recommends tab?
hmm ok
=== MyNameIsChris [~christoph@CWPP-p-144-134-229-155.prem.tmns.net.au]  has left #ubuntu ["Leaving"]

ok so you have too many libs sometimes
Anyone know how to modify the "Places" menu? Smeg doesn't seem to allow me to change it.
r2d4, Ok.  We determined that you don't need 'sudo' for that... as long as you are in the 'audio' group.  What does 'id | grep audio' print?  Anything, or nothing?
rbrenart: in any "open" dialog, you can pin things to it
karlheg, teamspeak is not in the archive. it's semi-commercial
What are your sound and multimedia settings from the panel menu System --> Preferences ?
id | grep audio       prints nothing

=== no0tic [~no0tic@host233-27.pool8251.interbusiness.it]  has joined #ubuntu

how can i change the color of the windows?
i checked out windows and theme in preferences
but they dunt help me
karlheg: can you explain what dependencies cannot be handled by apt or something similar?
karlheg, does nvclock work for you with latest ubuntu-nvidia drivers?
When you create a new desktop user, make sure to use the "Desktop" profile so they have access to audio, CD, etc.
=== stazz_ is now known as stazz
It says I am already a member of audio.
ThE__OnE, What windows are you referring to?
karlheg: It says I am already a member of audio
poningru, apt is what handles depends.  'dpkg' alone does not.  'apt' takes a package name, not a .deb file.  'dpkg' takes a .deb file; apt runs it for you.
you know the color aroung applications and places and systems, how can i change that?
A double click on a .deb would mean to run 'dpkg'.
ThE__OnE: do you mean the backround, which is normally white?

bob2 check it
microhaxo: so, now you have to stop whinging, forever
microhaxo: you're using captive ntfs
when it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces
what?
heh, actually
i dont do anything with my windows drives
i will be back later
i just boot to them>
19:56:42      microhaxo |  /dev/hdb1 /mnt/captive-new_volume captive-ntfs defaults,noauto 0 0
i have never Written to them
to fix teamspeak, maybe you might have an idea?
yea i installed that yesturday
microhaxo: whatever, you went out of your way to install and configure captive ntfs
it was broke YESTURDAY
i wanted to replace a dll
that ate your disk, that's entirely your own fault
in linux
bob2?
yes, writing to ntfs is not safe from linux
IT was FUCKING BROKEN B4 that!
and will corrupt your disk
omg
forget it

ekCo: never used it, sorry
microhaxo: ok!
captive ntfs installed = yesturday

k
Bob2 how do i remove captive ntfs
?
just delete the lines?
that would be a start
err
bob2
you installed it from source, so I ddon't know where you put the rest of the bits
Why not just put in the winXP disc and make repair the system?
captiventfs is on my EMPTY NTFS hd
windows is on hda1
microhaxo: ok!
oga: please keep things in the channel
bob2: that link isn't of any use... it doesnt help me get the codecs ?:S
oga: all I can suggest is reading the howto again and making sure you followed all the steps
thanks bob2
oga: and that the drivers support your card
God dammit, now i need to go buy a new windowsxp cd
:|
why on earth would you need to do that?
mine is Scratched to hell
if you installed windows, presumably you own a windows disk
its Scratched
i havent had to reinstall windows for EVER
it works FLAWLESSLY
buy pirated .... lots here
just by a cd de-scratcher

yes it does .. it does for us here

sorrry am not so techie, .. can't help you people who need help
i need help too
i dont have my cd key anymore, if i can boot into windows and retreive it

=== Swynndla [~Swynndla@210-54-11-182.ipsm.net.nz]  has joined #ubuntu
I need a better ntfs reader than the default (better error-handling), is there any such thing?
is installing .deb files individually dangerous? I've heard it can screw the system over if they fail!
microhaxo: Well, thats your fault. Why on earth would you store your cd-key on your harddrive?
nubbe: no
if i install form source how do i uninstall
err
cus i never had to use it
i didnt store it
i can get a program to read it
=== DagaZ [~rolle@h34n1fls35o858.telia.com]  has joined #ubuntu
Hylas: not if they're from ubuntu, but in practice you won't need to do that
like i said there is a way to change it and update it
off of windows
bob2, that's bad :(
with a keygen
for me
nubbe: why?
=== Nikopol [~mambo@i-195-137-15-67.freedom2surf.net]  has joined #ubuntu
anyway, all this windows stuff is off topic
take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
yes i had a simple question how do i uninstall something i installed from source
bob2: that site isnt in english :s lol
ubuntu, You need the have a ssh server installed on windows if you are to use ssh.
bah
because I've got xmms and mplayer here as rpm's and I was going to convert them to deb with alien then install them. I have a slow internet connection so i try to stay away from downloading
bob2, I could read some files with xp, but not with ubuntu, that I need...
If linux could actually run a damn game, CEDEGA is complete BS, wont run Counterstrike source whatso ever..
CDK: you can't, in general.  "make uninstall" might work if yo ustill have the original source tree still
microhaxo: so, if you're a paying customer, go to their site and vote for it
i c
Hylas: I'd strongly recommend not doing that
ok
it is "Supported"
bob2, and I know th aprtition is flaky, so I guess win handles the errors better
nubbe> what  files?
CDK: in future, checkinstall and stow are useful for that
microhaxo: then file a bug with them if it doesn't work
but just my luck it wont run on my sys
xabbul: ok i use secure shell client
okey
microhaxo: ranting here isn't going to help it work, sorry
nothing will help

im pissed
microhaxo: then be pissed somewhere else
CDK: plese keep it on-channel
nubbe> you said you can't view them in ubuntu ... that's why
CDK: they do different things, but checkinstall is probably simpler
sorry m8 i dont know how to talk to just you
GNULinuxer, No, I said I can't read them
GNULinuxer, As in ubuntu can't get the data from the ntfs part
ARG, i cannot connect to this FTP, it needs SECURE connection but when i use SSH2 it times out?!?!
nubbe> aha
using Gftp
Anyone knows of any hardware checking software for linux. That sees if something is broken like agp-ports and stuff.

microhaxo: I don't know what "ftp" you're talking about
i said
I hear gftp can do ftp/ssl, tho
its my prif ftp
anyway
"prif" is not a word
gFTP
itsa  damn TOPSITE Mk
so
I have no idea what a "TOPSITE Mk" is, either
you dont need to know
GNULinuxer, I can mount and read most of it, just a few files that has errors, and did under xp too, but I just didn't realise that before, since I could read them with xp (that is no more)
QUOTE WHOIS %s %s
i need to connect to a server with SECURE Access.
nubbe> it's corrupt now
microhaxo: throwing around buzzwords doesn't help
GNULinuxer, NOOO?? really??   ;)
microhaxo: presumably it speaks ftp/ssl
microhaxo: if that doesn't work, talk to whoever runs it
nubbe> the xp failure must have happended after you tried to read them from ubuntu, right?
yea sure, but how do i select this option in gFTP?
there is just drop down boxes
nubbe> just apt-get install ntfsprogs
ftp , http ,local ,ssh2,fsp
[12:15] <opteron>
GNULinuxer, I'll look at them
nubbe> and use ntfsfix from there and try to fix it
530 USE SECURE CONNECTION

gftp is pretty easy to use
and some dist-upgrade has broken my X keyboard layout
does anyone know anyting about name resolution?
lol thats what im using
tapia: you're using hoary, right?
and it wont connect meh
bob2: no, breezy
it worked rigth till today
whats the diff between breezy and hoary?
microhaxo: lftp does it
breezy is the development branch
i had it configured for spanish layour
layout
which is not recommended for people who can't fix their own systems
but now it is english
I guess X is broken again; you'll have to wait for daniel to fix it
try looking ni bugzilla, there's probably a workaround already
and gnome-keyboard-properties crashes if i try to change the layout

you use a gui client on windows? heh
wtf
microhaxo, you'll get used to it in no time :)
it's easy to use
they dont make a "Terminal" FTP client for windows
hah
microhaxo, theres plenty of gui ftp clients for linux too if you like
microhaxo: er, it ships with one
microhaxo, they do
microhaxo: type ftp in a command window sometime

Using Telnet to a website, what command downloads the page?
can anyone help me with a problem?  I keep getting "temporary failure in name resolution"  I can ping ip addrsses and the router but no domains.  I've checked resolv.conf and everything's ok there similarly with /etc/hosts... aaarrgghh!!! any ideas?
odie5533: GET
floo: can you ping the nameserves in /etc/resov.conf?
GET what?
just "GET"
thats the command
yes no probs there
GET $path HTTP/1.1
or just ues the GET command from libwww-perl
or wget
or ...
you need HOST too if you specify HTTP/1.1
hmm, right
the only reason why i dont like linux is: i spent lots of money on my nifty RADEON X800XT PE and linux cant do anything with it.
ok I'll give that a go, thanks
that's ATI's fault, not linux's
microhaxo: ebay
bah
no i am a GAMER
sell it, and buy a real card, an nvidia
me too
BAH
nvidia sucks ass
:O
i can own any of you in a 3dmark 05 benchmark
yeah my fx5200 works just fine in linux ;)
microhaxo: try to actually be polite
=== odie5533 chokes
and no one cares how big your video card is
xabul: ill tright it but connection refused he says
bah
mines like bigger than my box
bob2, talk for yoruself
it wont even fit in

lol
no
mine has 16 pipelines
anyone to spare a minute for a newbie?
hah
mine has its own power supply, and two led fans, i win
no
and my radeon works fine in ubuntu
mine works
Vassilis, dont ask to ask, just ask :)
