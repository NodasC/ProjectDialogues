kleedrac: I'm afraid not. Any version of mplayer except for -k7* should work for your cpu
does a subversion gnome client exist?
crimsun: Hmmm ... I wonder why it does that?
best media player: VLC /get wxvlc) It plays everything!
will: totem has caused me no troubles
totem xine
kleedrac: good question.
|QuaD same here.. totem-xine werkt geweldig
intinig: I don't see one in warty or hoary
xine is working great for video and xmms works great for mp3's but some of my music is in .wma as my wife ripped it
=== L0sT [~waa3@raptor.ukc.ac.uk]  has joined #ubuntu
xine is very good, with w32codecs
kleedrac: heh.. never needed a wma file played
intinig: however, there's always gsvn, as in http://gsvn.tigris.org/
but post processing with VLC is the way forward, it uses its own codecs (builtin)
Quad: consider yourself lucky :) worse quality than mp3 ... wish she'd learn to use oggenc that's why I installed it :)
intinig: that project, however, seems deprecated.
what should I use then?
kleedrac: is ogg open source?
Quad: absolutely
all Ogg-based codecs are open source

GAIM seems to kick me out of AOL chatrooms with consistently, but not any certain time index, and it won't allow me to re-join the same chatroom.  How can I diagnose this further to help get a fix?
kleedrac: I don't think I'll be able to connect; your IP is a 192.168. :)
ironwolf: that seems like something i owuld go to #gaim for
i don't believe we have any gaim developers here

thanks. 'computer' is pretty important :)
mplayer-custom
mplayer-doc
mplayer-fonts
kleedrac: ah, but you installed "mplayer-custom", which the wiki says will not work.
Oh?  I didn't even realize!  How do I correct this?
kleedrac: remove mplayer-custom and install mplayer-586 instead
kleedrac: the reason for the illegal instruction is quite simple: mplayer-custom is compiled with SSE2 support, which your Pentium III does not support
kleedrac: your Pentium III (like mine) only supports MMX, MMX2, and SSE

aboutToUbuntu: oh you are using xemacs

that will update the package listing
bluewheel, i did that
aboutToUbuntu: hoary or warty
warty
thats expected... it is stable
not bleeding edge
so ... if i wanted, say, openoffice 1.1.3, I have to wait?
or vnc 4.x
or install it by hand
there is a backports repository... but it might break your system
how do i set up a usb modem???
so, as far as I can remember, openoffice has a very nice and easy installed, or at least it was with suse. will it do the same thing here, and will it mess with the rest of my system?
*installer
aboutToUbuntu: i owuld reccomend the back ports repo... but thats jsut me
nice, ubuntuguide.org
that's easier to remember

rattboi24: is that the link for backports?

does order matter for rsync  --include and --exclude's ?

Can it handle Access mdb files ???

wood1: how do you figure? is isn't multithreaded, no server archetecture... what is it ahead on????
Well if all you want is a database software to handle 2 million records, Access is faster than the wind
wood1: i REALLY hope you are kidding.... access is slow
want me to get you technical papers comparing that to others>
OOo can handle .mdb on platforms that support the MS Jet Database Engine...
wood1: if access is so powerful, why is it soo cheap and microsoft sql server like a couple grand?
Well have you done that ?
Can you get OpenOffice to handle *.mdb files

why is the openoffice group making the same mistakes as microsoft has done, world doesnt need another access clone database wizard :/
http://www.rekallrevealed.org/  <-- if you don't mind using a KDE app
wood1, I did plenty of Access work, what got you stuck ? i have not sued it in a while now in favor of SQL for a varity of reasons
isn't OOo actually a MS Office clone?
not really
wood1: if you are new.... then why did you make comments how access is so superior
first versions of StarWriter date back to the 1980s  :)
Simira, OOo is opene source version of StarOffice
Well bluewheel, I have a Access Database which contains 20 fields
Simira, bluewheel: sql is a language not a database... you use sql within access and mysql
It's has just 1 primary key
1 primary key ouch
It has 10 tables which has relationships with the Master table
=== pitti [~pitti@213.151.107.243]  has joined #ubuntu
QuaD, I said that I need an esay interface like Access. I will spend about 6 months to devote my time to master the SQL language but for now, I have to stick to Access
The only reason I have to switch to Windows is only because of Access
Don't you get it ???
Simira, i didn't know access used sql ?
access is based on Jet, which is somewhat like sqlite
why does on e have to excuse oneself for using Windows? *switches between mIRC and OE
bluewheel: yes
Simira: traitor!
if I recall correctly access uses something like sql but no quite alike
Simira, you don't / should not have to, but many people in this room might beg to differ, personally i spend 50% of my time on a Mac
microsoft uses jet engine...
So can somebody help me if I can somehow use some kind of application in Linux to import my Access Database
I mean access uses that.
=== Simira does *not* apology for using Windows
=== svenl_ is now known as svenl
wood1: I really doubt anything can do that
The Access database has 1 Primary key with 20 fields and has 10 separate tables which has relationships with the master table
wood1: you can learn basic SQL in 2 hours...
=== tsw has also windows now, for drawing few elctronic schematics
maybe one
wood1: if you can dump the sql, you might be able to munge it into a linux rdbms, but this is an access question, not an ubuntu one
wood1 maybe you can dump the database and import it into mysql
Well is there a way to import the Access Database to MySQL ?
yes
Wow that's great
wood1: you'll need to go ask some forum where questions about Access are on-topic
How do I go about doing that ?
wood1: #windows, perhaps
wood1: try google...
in your "Access database" make a foreign tables that link to a MySQL tables
wood1: 05:04 < wood1> Well if all you want is a database software to handle 2 million records, Access is faster than the wind,  05:03 < wood1> Come on, let's be fair, Access is well ahead in terms of Database, i don't think you should just install windows and use their propietary stuff
and then just copy everything   :-p
foreign tables (or wather it's called is under import or link or something like that IIRC
The main point that I was and am trying to get is getting MySQL to import the Access database and use some kind of simple applications to edit the values

we use ubuntu on all our servers and see no reason for anyone else not to
boot with 'linux custom' in the installer and you won't get gnome or anything

you don't need separate server and desktop releases

I cant see a distro doing a good desktop and server from a single CD
there are lots of custom-target distros that do quite well, look at knoppix

qazwer, ahh ok have a friend in Bejing at the moment
Kamion: yeah but your not going to have apache mysql and php and a few mail server options squished into that single CD
hehe,3q,but how to only to say you?
I think there is a need for server / desktop products to be differant, if for no other reason than we accept more failure on our desktop
a server though needs a seperate toobox to interface with since it is locked away somewhere deep in the depths
yes and the server rig can be a good money earner
linux_galore: sure, but that's ok, you can get them from the network totally trivially. people installing servers will be picking their own package sets anyway.
if GNOME crashes, that has no effect on your web server
linux_galore, and there is that, I mean people don't mind paying for a server OS and if it undercuts windows then it is very viable option for TCO
there's no reason to say 'let's make something stable for our servers and it's OK, our desktops can be complete crap'
Kamion: I can do that with Novell too but II dont get the Enterprise server rig for that reason i get it because everything on the CD works together very well
daniels, but people accept it, it does not mean they will look at deiban stable, it has a very good version of gnome
everything in Ubuntu main should work together just as well as everything on the CD
as in it's stable as hell
where is the folder where the page should be in apache for linux? How can I change that?
i cant see Ubuntu or Debian taking any market share away from rh or novell anytime soon... the thing is people want proven stable packages
Kamion:  I dont want a desktop Ive already done that....now I want a dedicated server solution
plus a big name
linux_galore: I wasn't contradicting that in the slightest
arctick, yea and peope also want to pay for software that comes from a nice big company who will certify and support it
__learner__: /var/www/
tx a lot
Kamion: as soon as the customer install either red hat or Novell guess whats happens........both of those companies will throw in a 12 month desktop install for free....bye bye Ubuntu
the guy who runs all our servers doesn't want his distribution to pick the set of packages though; he wants to select them by hand and have them be the minimal possible selection to reduce security exposure
linux_galore: our releases are all supported for 18 months and we'll be doing longer-term support options too.
if I set LC_ALL=zh_CN,I want save filename by zh_CN not UTF8, how can i do it?
wow, sounds like you got an admin that cares

distributions are about large-scale software integration and support; they aren't just about picking package sets for you 'cos you don't want to bother managing your server
linux_galore: you don't get security support over three release cycles with Debian
daniels, it's more than just free, it just works
linux_galore: er, no, Ubuntu and Debian are different distributions, with different installers, packages, hardware support, and package sets
daniels: no Im saying Ubuntu needs to go beyond the desktop
debian / gentoo / freebsd are just free
linux_galore: it's already there

im going to try to learn php+sql
if you're managing a reasonable number of servers then you'll have a local mirror anyway
that's what all the server admins I know do
since you don't want to download all the security updates a dozen times
linux_galore: so you'd be happy if someone generated cd images without gnome but with dovecot?
yes I just grab a server enterprise CD shove it in one machine bingo I have a mirror......no having to play with packages Im not sure of on a download.......also I know all the apps on the CD have been integrated into the admin tool kit
bob2: yes but also with the services/apps have a admin interface....ie a beefed up webmin/control center
hah
that's what we're doing with everything in main, not just with the CD
only integrating the CD is the lazy distro's approach
yes but no X....just a remote browser login
Kamion: you mean lazy as in "doesnt chew up time"
linux_galore: like it or not customers want to install stuff not on the CD, so any sane distro will integrate that stuff too
unless your beloved CD is *all* that's supported, in which case they're offering less

(the symptoms of this particular problem are that while playing CDs directly works fine, ripping hem causes cdparanoia to go "++++" and sound-juicer to go at approximately 0.3x speed
 ... mjg59 said that there were possibly issues with 2.6.8 and .9 with ripping, so...)
BockBilbo, did you install a dud kernel ? might want to use a live cd and then fix your config
bluewheel, is not that
the prob is that i have to install win for my parents
and it will erase grub init
Kamion: I presume that this means there isn't a terribly authoritative place to go for earlier ubuntu-flavoured kernels
so i need to reinstall grub after installing win

Hello
I popped in earlier talking about building an older kernel

 which came with Ubuntu Warty)

so, speaking of annoyed...  I have one nagging problem left with Hoary, and after a little poking around on the forums and the wiki, haven't found anyone else having it...
My screen starts to flicker as if the refresh rate is incorrect every time I log in.
Xophe: please report bugs only on kernels that come from us
Xophe: do not send reports for kernel you compiled yourself
The problem being that this is an LCD (laptop) and one generally doesn't set the refresh or sync rate on them as far as I understand.
Xophe: also.. out kernel is patched.. so it is pointless to use our config on a vanilla kernel

I thought it might help to install the binary kernel, but it appears to only be available for Warty right now, and I'm not sure it would help anyhow.
Any sugggestions?
fabbione: ok: "my CD-ROM drive does not work for ripping CDs"
but the point of building a non-Ubuntu kernel was that I have been informed that there are bugs in 2.6.8.x and 2.6.9.x regarding ripping CDs
and before reporting a bug as a kernel bug (probably hardware-specific) I wanted to test this theory

Xophe: if it was such a big problem people would have reported it much earlier than now
hello, who is member of ubuntu team members, there is no list on the website (or i'm blind) ...
how many people are running Ubuntu on "IBM IntelliStation A Pro"s?
so my suggestion is still report a bug (severity minor) with all possible details, including try more than one tool
and not just "cdrip" doesn't work
*sigh*
Xophe: afaik, linux-source-2.8.* is the ubuntu patched source and kernel-source-* is the unpatched source, so maybe try with linux-source if you haven't already
I'm trying to install ubuntu on a G3 iMac - doesn't anyone know of any free tools to resize a Mac OS X partition? (HFS, I think)

an intel driver program

RPM is the format used for Redhat
sam_: they don't have a deb file?
What they said.
RPM=redhat package manager
then go to synaptics again, hit reload and you should see new versions :O
oh.
well
if they have a .deb file - you'd be better off
but you can make a .rpm work if you have to
sam_: you can use a program called alien
okay

but i'm not sure if i could install alien either
why?
I can give you a hand with that if you need it.

yes there are gdesklets

some higher powered G4 weren't so bad with LOTS and LOTS of RAM
drspin: for the price they are charging, they should have a g5
estebandido: what exactly is the error?
you have to install gdesklets, but it is in the universe repositories
but, i have a problem... i have to tell gentoo where the kernel is every time i boot
okay, who has a favorite app i should look into?

thanx dude
well it should be enough but not for kde and OO
but if your hardware is old, you can have troubles installing it, due to driver issues...

lsmod doesnt say anything ati related
just change warty to hoary in sources
thanks
gamecat: what is your wireless problem
I just want to see what happens :)
yeh do that
repositories that is
Orbo: that's because lsmod is for kernel modules
it would be XFree86-4.0.log for you i think
Orbo you should be using the fglrx driver for your card
I like ubuntu overall but I would like more customization in terms of install base apps, (ex. no games and such)
so "grep /var/log/XFree86-4.0.log fglrx"

yeh just remove them :O

so what's my course of action? Do I need to ... hmm.
well what other method u going to use then
HrdwrBoB: most chipset drivers in linux don't support that
if you're using hoary, you can apt-get install netapplet
godsmoke: atheros chipset; assume I'm using the madwifi drivers since it shows up as ath0.
does that support it?
hrm ...
dunno
gamecat: tryit and you will know :)
give it a try
gee he needs net to get hoary
I don't use atheros
what do you use?
anyone here using a card with prism2 chipset?
 ipw2200 here
no my wifi card is a DWL-G630
centrino
guess I'm going to upgrade to hoary and watch my ubuntu break
thanks for the help
it won't break
swj: you are new to debian, and going to hoary? not reccomended
at any rate, doing this automatically isn't top priority; if I can just figure out what to put in manually, that's good enough for now.

oh yeah well i've started this thing here at least 10 times today
is there a way to get the source used to compile debian packages?
irq 11 is over loaded
yes
well i didnt do a thing, just a default setup

No compile anything in a debian derived system you will first need build-essential

zsnes package tells me that I need a libpng upgrade
how would I do this?
if you apt get zsnes, and there is a libpng that satisfies it, it would get it for you

melazyboy2: no,just drops to the next line
randabis-laptop: geneo91 That is his problem -- but doing it for him won't really help him unless you want to admin his box.
Orbo: Thats because apt will check your sources in /etc/apt/sources.list, and you are using the default which is Warty -- warty ensures that all software is time tested and secure, zsnes for some reason either didn't pass that or it has proprietary or non-free code in which case it would be in the 'multiverse'
well he needs to read for 5 hours then
so what you need to do is as root, edit /etc/apt/sources.list, and at the end add universe multiverse

there's a package called flexold for old flex I think

k, I updated the source.list before and ran that command
oh so cant do it through apt? :(
does that officially add the servers or something?
bitfoo there's an old version of flex in the repos
Orbo: yes editing sources.list adds the servers, apt-get update, makes the computer aware of the change, and syncs your list with that of the server
no
melazyboy2: great!
now I understand
thanks
Orbo: Did it work?

anyone here use cedega?  I'm wondering if it has all the regular wine stuff plus extras... I want to run a few other windows apps besides games... can cedega handle those
?
it should be able to run windows apps like wine
that's what I was thinking randabis
but wasn't sure
if 5.04 gets delayed until 5.05, will we therefore see 5.11 rather than 5.10?
like wine ? do u mean they are developing their own stuff ?
no

I'm under the expert install menu, and I'm asked for which type of partition I would like to choose.  I'm listed BSD, MSDOS, SUN, and a few others.  I'm not to sure as I am always receiving "Error 16" from grub.  Any ideas?
maybe I should have said like wine DOES
Anyone really good with mounting things?
uh...you want your partition to be ext3 or reiserfs most likely...other options are jfs and xfs
randabis-laptop, those are file systems, not partition table types..
froust:  what do you want to mount
right
I haven't done an expert install so I dunno

Hi. I need help installing wxPython
=== vtg [vertigo@route6.alumina.nl]  has joined #ubuntu
It can't find gtk when I try installing from source
People have said that it can be apt-get'ed, but there's no wxPython package in the repository
Could someone help me?
Turominio: you probably don't have the gtk development packages
No, I just apt-get'ed them. No difference
=== syn-ack goes to sleep();
Turominio: there seems to be libwxgtk2.4-python. is that even close?
lemme try
how can I get python 2.4?
compile myself? debian package?
Package libwxgtk2.4-python is not available, but is referred to by another package.
(response from apt-get)
hmm, but its not python2.4
Turominio: weird. i wonder what repository gives me that package

Is it save to add debian to the source list?
nir: not really
Yeah, I only have archive and security (.ubuntu.com) in the source list
so the best would be to compile python?
Turominio: i even have the package installed, don't know why
nir: get hoary sources and build from there, it's easiest
can I add hoary source to my sources list?
I'm using warty
or Sid sources, doesn't matter
what would be the addresses for those?
nir: add deb-src lines, not deb :)

all of them?
ok awesome
how do i get a copy?
why would someone even think about using anything else than a debian deritive

well, it installs gnome by default, but you can get pretty much everything from the universe and multiverse repositories

?
Got the powerpc ver of ubuntu to chuck on a g3 ibook i was given
playing with it a bit, pressed power button, black screen with flashing _ ... restarted and now x-server wont start
=== mjr guesses that the restricted part would be because of included firmware, but hasn't bothered to check
"I cannot start the X server (your graphical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly."
stuff hmm. sounds like a power management problem. tried rebooting?
numerous times, same thing.
had a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
how do I open it

I am new to Ubuntu and i would like to set up an apache2 server on it. I find 2 files apache.conf and httpd.conf. Which of these 2 configuration files should i edit. Under Red Hat its the httpd.conf file where we set the servername, server admin email
stuff: try "less /var/log/XFree86.0.log"
stuff at the end of that junk - there should be a reeason why it failed
Ok, I'll have a quick glance over it, brb

and that causes the machine to shut down ;)

nope
its installed, but no 3d

thats strange, gedit uses the gnome-print stuff which works with cups, why doesnt abiword use this gui as well??
well it sucks
but it should still come build into every distro
farruinn: shoot... I don't think that even has it
bascule, i dunno i read some article about port surfing and it said to do this and it is legal... i dunno lol
Pluk: what's that?
the ati 3d driver
like solaris comes with openwin
shad0w1e: why is that?
will I have to restart to upgrade to hoary?
because its like 100KB window system
with the basic: a window system
shad0w1e: icewm would be a betetr choice
port sufring with telnet i old news, it just raises alarms and gets you in trouble
Pluk: this is an nvidia laptop
lavigj: that sucks :/
err adapater
shad0w1e: it's lighter than flux
once hula includes ical, it is going to be awesome
it's good to have when everything else is dead
shad0w1e: I concur, fluxbox rox
maybe nvidia;s 3d is bugging acpi too
fluxbox can't rock
its a window system
thats it
although it is leagal, it is an unfriendly gesture, like walking about a night with a torch looking in windows

Ok. Can anyone lend me some advice? During the ubuntu base installation, every time the installer hits a certain point, my laptop just shuts off. no warning, no apparant reason. I'm using an array 4 hoary CD image from the URL in the topic. Any clues?
why does ubuntue never prompt me for a root password on install?
ramb0: RTFM
user cupsys is now in groups dialout, lp and shadow.  Authrorization still fails.
ramb0: because there is none
ramb0: cuz root account is disabled by default, it uses sudo instead, if you want a root account afaik after you log in you sudo passwd
MacPlusG3: be kind

yes
ubuntu2u, >> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SSHHowto

so i could do `root or something and have the bot spit that out

after that you need to restart cupsys through /etc/init.d/cupsys restart

ah soz
Pluk: I want to use "tramp" package in emacs
stuNNed: oh, well for gui apps it's usually better to use gksudo or kdesudo (or whatever the kde equivalent is)

jesuel: I don't want to do this
ssh requires a username as well as a host
you could enable root to ssh in

e.g., bohunk@xyz.com

so have you guys seen hula?
that is ssh bohunk@xyz.com
?
?
what's hula

trans_err, maybe that was the problem
I'm not that bad
lol regeya
i got X-chat open
I just upgraded to hoary... I think... and everything on the toolbars is gone
ah, nice
tux_: i just rolled up a deb if you want to try her out
ok
it said the "trash applet" crashed and now there's nothing else on the toolbar
but I got a theme : how to install?
i will build it
regeya: sorry I just wanted to know if I really need root password to use tramp - nothing more
tux_: make sure to grab the xinerama-devs -- for some reason it fails the build if you dont have them
marcin_ant: I wish I knew what the logic of not setting a root password is, but I don't.  So, my suggestion would be to set a root password, run emacs sudo, or run off and investigate how to get tramp to do what you want to do because not only do I not know, I don't need to know how to do what you want to do.
you have to be kidding me

what file holds the information for iptables?  I'm switching from windows and I need to use identd to or a fake ident to connect to some irc servers so I need to edit it
hi, I'm back
no luck
i mean i could set here and pull my hairs out trying to get it working but i think it would be pointless considering its not released yet :)
just my thought
ImagistTD: did you try each option singly? "noapic" for instance.
how do I make apt restore the init script for inetd
I didnt touch
it
im likin graveman =d
=D
but it keeps complaining that it cant fix it

mebaran151: --reinstall install
im gonna go install hoary
later
thanks
here's what I typed after boot: linux pci=noapci noapic.  I also tried pci=noapic noacpi in case I mistyped it
cromsun_, no
i'll try that
ImagistTD: typo on pci=noaCPi
I dont want to break a whole bunch of dependency
but I would like to use xinetd
SiRrUs: i did a man on gksudo trying to get an understanding of it what exactly does it do? is it a group sudo or something just curious to learn new commands thanks
and remove inetd regular
netkit-inetd

=== subterrific [~jason@subterrific.net]  has joined #ubuntu
crimson, that's what I typed.  above it a typo
gksudo = sudo for the window system

aww ok thanks
I'm going to go try every possible combination of noa with the letters c, p, and i after them that I can think of until something works
I;m very frustrated
useful since some programs will install an icon with the command gksu <filename>... and since ubuntu doesn't have root by default, it won't let ya run em
=== ImagistTD [~Owner@216-164-138-2.c3-0.upd-ubr5.trpr-upd.pa.cable.rcn.com]  has left #ubuntu []
delltony here you go The command is a frontend to sudo. Its primary purpose is to run graphical commands that need root without the need to run an X terminal emulator and using su or sudo directly
=== tim [~tim@pool-68-238-69-154.lax.dsl-w.verizon.net]  has joined #ubuntu
ok
so do you do it only once?
and it sets it up?
or do yo uhave to issue gksudo k3b each go round?
nope everytime it starts
ok
looking for help setting up plone on warty, any luck?
so basically in a way its a dummie sudo to fool the application so to speak
:)
delltonY: make an icon and use gksudo k3b as the command
sounds good to me and you said it automatically installs an icon for you?
yeah i did that
working fine actually
and thanks for the help
not for kde files, I don't believe
you can add it to a menu, though

tell me i hear alot about hoary not working with backports and all tht good stuff, well i have used backports and my question is this. when hoary becomes offical will i have major issues upgrading or will there be away to remove the backports so the upgrade with hopefully go smooth?
still no luck
I entered the parameters separately
all they did was create different speeds of flickering when the install hangs
delltony sorry i dont know anything about backports :)
thats cool maybe you can help on this one you know of any way to get paltalk to work on wine. i believe the frankscorner method is way outdated
for its version 5.0 and pal is on 7.0 now
the winedebuger comes up but unfortunately for me i hve no idea how to understand it :(
delltony try crossover think you can get a 30 day trial to see if you like it
i tried that and really didn't like it
cause winetools seems just like crossover
and why pay for something that you already have to the most part :)
:)
got very quiet in here
yeah, I still can't figger out my issue :)
?
I just realized it was a mistake to install windows on a ntfs partition
I need to figure out where the rules for iptables is stored so that I can edit them to use identd to connect to some irc servers
installing windows is always a mistake
it was only for games
I know, just joking

if I can figure out how to run the sims 2 in wine, I wouldn't need windows
I just installed the newest ubuntu realese and it isn't making use of both procs. do i need to recompile the kernal with smp suport or is there an esier way
but I don't think I can
for that matter, I can't even access the windows partition
so I don't think I can run it
mpq, can't access it ?
im gonna try out the livecd- will that run how ubuntu will normally run
Sony needs to give me a computer powered by 8 cell processors
I would be happy
it tells me I don't have permission to access the partition
the sims 2 has huge graphics
GregoryD, me too LOL
I'm surprised that you can run it at all on a laptop
heydude, it would probably be slower
linux101 why not just aptitude the kernel
because it will be running off the cd
hi all. i know this SOUNDS stupid but it's what i'm experiencing and is 100% reproducible on my machine. any .pdf i upload becomes corrupt. checked this with attachments on gmail and hotmail. jpg attachment worked fine. i'm on hoary. would someone else be kind enough to see if it's just me? this is important to me as i got a 0 on an assignment i spent 5 hours doing yesterday because i couldn't print it.
hmm didn't think of that

kay, one last try
linux101: yeah there smp kernel is your best bet :P
the*
is it possible to access ntfs partitions outside of windows?
because I don't think it is
mpq: yes
as in mounting them?
 I had an error when the boot disk was "Loading components of the Ubuntu Installer". Everything goes fine until it comes to "Retrieving nic-extra-modules-2.6.8.1-3-386-di". Then the screen flickers (looks like an infinite loop)
I think I read somewhere that it would be read-only
mpq: do something like `mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/point/
if so, it wouldn't help me
mpq: oh...
I can't install the sims 2 outside of windows
and I can't run it from the partition in hoary
I'm running on a Dell Inspiron 1100, Pentium 4, version A06 chipset
mpq: yeah, if you want stable read&write support between win&lin, i think fat is the way to go
which would require that I uninstall windows
anyway good night everyone
you can read ntfs partitions fine, just not write
mpq: no..windows comes with an ntfs->fat32 conversion utility i think
really?
it does?
I thought it was only the other way
=== K-Rich [~krich@216-190-167-148.bras01.sho.az.frontiernet.net]  has left #ubuntu []
hehe, i think it does both
i don't think it is i think its only one way honestly
i'll boot and check if you'll see if .pdf attachments work for you...deal?
windows doesn't like fat
so I don't see why it would
hey- will the live CD - run the same as a normal install- i wanna see how fast the os works
it won't be as fast as the install
k
heydude: negative, reading off a cd is much slower than reading off a hd
because it will be limited by cd read speed
ok
mpq: deal?
huh?
if you'll check if .pdf file uploads (such as in a html-based e-mail attachment), i will look for that ntfs->fat32 tool
delltony,  it does work bolth ways
if I convert NTFS to FAT32 will it destroy the data?
preferable
**cough** i mean no
if I had a choice I wouldn't have windows at all
but my sister is addicted to the sims 2 and my computer is the only one in the house that can handle it
can someone help me partition a drive
im trying to have a dual boot- windows/linux - i dunno what the hell im doing
I'm going to try something from the documentation again
will someone check the reproducibility pdf attachment issue i'm having (posted in detail 7-8 minutes ago), please?
I may know what I did wrong
where in xp? cause i tried it before i know partition magic 8 will do it

you downloaded partition magic?

are you sure it's partition magic?

http://www.ntcompatible.com/thread18987-1.html
i downloaded a zip file online with some things
is there another program i can use
an open source one?
partition magic is retail
mpq, you don't want fat32.. believe me... fat32 has a 4gig filesize cap
k
qtparted on knoppix
works good
come on, no one in here is nice enough to check if a .pdf http upload works for them on hoary?
just had to slip that in
=== VR^ [VR@154-111.200-68.tampabay.rr.com]  has joined #ubuntu
what about fat?
?
that is true too what sulkd  said
is there a cap on FAT?
fat is very limited...
that is why ms uses ntfs now
I can't use NTFS outside of windows
right
if you have two boxes you can
I don't have two boxes
ms should switch to rieserFS
you can samba into it
mpq, yeah.. each file can only be 4 gigabyte... which doesnt suit me since I have some dvdr images
each file?
and using ext3 in windows is not really working .. except for reading
I thought you meant the entire partition
mpq, well you can read ntfs just fine..
tux_: ext3 in windows? how?
but I can't write to it
which doesn't help
mpq, maybe what you need is a flash unit for carrying files between linux and windows
I have that
but that's not the point
ok
diego, there is an opensource app called explorerext2 or some such
yeah
the problem is that the I only have windows to run the sims 2
tux_: cool, i'll have to check that out sometime
the flash things suck anyway, I think they even are fat formatted
he is wanting to dual boot windows linux if i understand him right
if I could run it in linux I could uninstall windows
but I can't
diego, handy tool
mpq then in that cause use that free vmware qeum i thnk it is
mpq, why uninstall windows...
case even
I can't
just delete the partition
or rather format it
if I uninstall windows I can't run games
lol
mpq, i have many games installed
my sister is addicted to the sims 2 and my computer is the only one that can run it
thats why i keep windows for the games
dude like i stated run that vmware program that is the free one i forget the name someone can help me with that
mpq, that is why i have another system .. just for windows crap... got the system from the dumpster
oh come on, we all know that if you want to run games it's best to just use windows and not even bother with cedega..
but i use vmware personally to play games and what have you
I can't afford another box
delltony, i think qemu will do that for you
if I could I sure wouldn't dual boot
yeah thats it
thanks for the name
delltony, run games in a windows that is run over an emulator?
mpq, nice to hear
yeah i run windows xp full install in vmware
and the games work fine
mpq, can you afford another hdd ?
haven't tested all games
no
but once like deer hunter and all work fine

OmniColos: So ubuntu seems to work well on that iBook?  How about suspend and such?  I ask because I have a friend with the same machine.
can i kill -9 gnome?
wow this is a bit hectic, there needs to be different rooms for all this lol
heydude, 1/2 the time when im away from my comp and i come back, i come back to see that my comp is frozen, what logs do i see to find out whats causing the freezing?
suspend is wierd... I am still playing with it... and I think I messed up installing powerfrefs :D
lucid: Just do ctrl+alt+f3 and then telinit 3 to kill x

i want help with "Ubuntu" system installation
how generally successful is a new kernel install in ubuntu?
if ubuntu recognizes the 3c940 on my p4 box I'll be very happy
i mean is it easy
qlo-xael: are you building or using apt?
ubuntu was the first one I successfully ran
why doesnt hoary update to OOo 1.1.4 ?
hello????
I tried using knoppix but I didn't know how to burn an image
myzt1qu3: what help ?
i cannot even startx
i just compiled 2.6.10 for slackware not too long ago and it seemed to work fine, only my man pages broke
now i'm considering compiling in ubuntu, just curious how reliable
maybe i shoudl try aptget or dselect?
I was not able to comlplete the gentoo install and I had the mandrake boot problem on this ibook...
is gamin fubared when it comes to NFS?
qlo-xael: thought you may be refering to the latest security updated kernel
so I tried Gnoppix live and that worked great, found out it was based on Ubuntu, so that was my next stop
and it installed like melted butter on toast
synaptic is incredible...

then you can grag the file link from the browser to the listed thems themes
what X configuration file does ubuntu use?

jacquesmerde: Dude.  Static.
jacquesmerde u steel need dns
jacquesmerde, you need your computer's name and IP in the other machines' /etc/hosts
ivoks, how do i use this DNS mastery? why doesnt ubuntu do it be default? archlinux does, and it does NOTHING for me by default
jacquesmerde u are wrong, man
jacquesmerde: Ubuntu aims for desktop.  It doesn't install servers by default.
jacquesmerde: aptitude install bind9 and RTFM.
jacquesmerde no software knows what computers are on network
thoreauputic, thats hard if its DHCP though
jacquesmerde: The usual DHCP solution is to provide DNS for IPs, hand them out arbitrarially, and the result is that the hostname doesn't tie to any one computer.
ivoks, what i plug in 192.168.1.1 into my browser and look at my routers setup, i can click on "dhcp table" and it shows me a "client hostname" for every computer connected EXCEPT for the ubuntu machine

karsten no, no...
jowe: Talk to metalsand
ivoks: yes yes yes.
karsten when u bring up dhcp server
jowe, my computer uses that .inf
karsten and it starts to give leases
ivoks: ... Default Windows name resolution order is WINS, then BIND.
karsten usually it writes something like:
ivoks: Your host announces itself to the network via WINS.  That's how it's found.
jacquesmerde - do you know where I can download the .inf?

stuNNed, the dhcp client
*d
Seveas: ah ok thanks
Seveas, : yeah, I did that, but I can only find 2.6.10 and 2.6.11
stuNNed: Unless I'm grossly mistaken (and this is a posibility), your typical Windows LAN nameservice is *WINS*, *not* DNS.
ivoks, am i REALLY an idiot?
metalsand, yeah for ubuntu (well, kubuntu I guess.)
fdr, apt will not show it if you're on hoary, but you can download the deb from archive.ubuntu.com
jacquesmerde yes
:))
karsten: unless WINS is disabled i would guess
stuNNed: Now that's an empirically testable hypothesis.
jacquesmerde go to /etc/dhcp3 dir
karsten, a dhcp client can send a hostname in a dhcp request...
ivoks: You sure your windows host doesn't have a locally assigned name it's passing on, or that your logging tool isn't assigning it a name based on a WINS IP lookup?
jacquesmerde and remove comment "send host-name"
no need to use wins
ivoks, /etc/dhcpc?
Seveas: how does the dhcp client get the hostname?
karsten it isn't about logging tool, it's about dhclient
stuNNed, that's set in /etc/hostname
jacquesmerde /etc/dhcp3/
just the name you gave it upon install
or another name if you changed it...
jacquesmerde there is file dhclient.conf
Seveas: DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provide a mechanism whereby the server can provide the client with information about how to configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how the client can access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so on).
Seveas: From TFM>

da_bon_bon, "The main server gpg key is screwed up" happy now ? *G*
that says that the client sends the hostname 'demosi1' in the dhcp request
da_bon_bon, try an apt-get update
da_bon_bon: please chill out
ivoks, i edited the file, ifdown'ed and ifup'ed...
thoreauputic: no jokes
da_bon_bon, actually I have no idea if that's true BTW
Seveas: did it 7 times
thoreauputic: please try apt-get update and u will know
jacquesmerde now check out ur DHCP server and search for ur hostname
bob2: any idea what i must do now ?
bob2: can you help me out with some troubleshooting?
da_bon_bon, then simply wait, these errors sometimes happen. They will resolve...
Seveas: How does the server resolve name collisions?
da_bon_bon, I'm doing that as we speak

Windows Gotcha No #1346 created a 8gig DVD image and windows can't lift anything that big and move it from one drive to another. Linux to the rescue! - any hints?
great
so i am not the only one :)
anyway, see ya guys after an hours
gotta run
bye all
ivoks, i went to dhclient.conf, commented out the line "send host-name "andare.fugue.com"" (NO idea where that line came from), ifdown'ed if up'ed. and checked my router's dhcp client table..
IIIEars, fat32 file size limit is 4gb
if your dest. partition is fast32, there's no way of doing this
am i stuck?
jacquesmerde u fool
jacquesmerde why didn't u put in ur hostname??
can i DD or something?
IIIEars: What version of 'Doze?  What FS?
IIIEars, very bad idea
IIIEars, Rar it into smaller pieces, and create .isos from those?
ivoks, why should it make a difference?
Fat 32 XP
IIIEars, no eay of doing it
IIIEars: Move on one system, or move to another location?
ivoks, do i put my hostname in "s?
jacquesmerde put in ur hostname without .xx.com
metalsand: man split.
fat32 cannot handle files that are bigger than 4 gb
IIIEars: 'man split'
so you're screwed :)
move to an external USB drive
jacquesmerde ifdown ethx
so "myhost" or myhost?
jacquesmerde killall -9 dhclient3
IIIEars, usb disks generally are fat32 too
IIIEars: How big's the file, what's the source of it?
jacquesmerde send host-name "imafool"
Seveas: They can be reformatted ;-)
karsten, :o)
Great! - Linux power. - you guys keep feeding it. :)
IIIEars, if you format (under windows) your >8gb usb drive into fat32, that's an option
IIIEars: Where is the image now, what FS, and how do you know it's a valid image?
into ntfs i meant*

IIIEars: Try this under linux:  cd /tmp; mkdir foo; cd foo; dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1m count=20m; split -b 1m bigfile
open(2) mentions a O_LARGEFILE flag.. Where is this defined? a grep of /usr/include reveals nothing...
Seveas, dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/zope-groupuserfolder_3.1.1-3ubuntu2_all.deb
IIIEars: ...that creates a 20 MB file, then splits it into 20 1 MB chunks.
ish, most likely in a bits/something include file
IIIEars: the chunks are named bigfile.aa bigfile.ab bigfile.ac ...
IIIEars: ...and you can cat them back together:  cat bigfile.* > bigfile-new
i think stdio.h should include that too, so try including stdio.h
ivoks, i'd add a page to the wiki to save people like me a lot of time, but i still dont quite understand what i did
Okay - I can do that. :)

IIIEars: ...which I've actually run, so it works as badvertised.
ivoks, i have a nameserver, 210.15.254.240
for some reason fluxbox takes much longer to load than gnome. I know that ubuntu is optimised to start gnome fast (very impressive) but does this affect the speed of other window managers?
karsten, "badvertised" is a nice typo ;)
jacquesmerde so u see, u have nameservers of ur ISP
the dd command got me interested in linux i love it's power. :)
jacquesmerde if u put a name in /etc/cups/client.conf it will search that name on couple of places
thoreauputic: Who says it's a typo?
IIIEars: It should get you interested in JCL.
jacquesmerde first it will look in /etc/hosts to find it there, if it isn't there, it will contact namservers

testest
IIIEars: dd ~= Norton Ghost.  But for Linux, tar and equivalents are far more useful.
metalsand: failfail
jacquesmerde read again what i just said
ivoks, i can't set up hosts because i'm on DHCP, yeah?
jacquesmerde well... right
I really wish I got my PCMCIA card set up :(
jacquesmerde so u can setup dns on ur router
I have a feeling it's going to take a lot of tweaking to get it working
jacquesmerde and connect it with dhcp
I seem to be having some trouble with my firefox flash plugin, when i goto a flash site that does a content pop-up I can only see like 1/5 of the flash page in the new window, the rest of window is white. Has anyone experienced this?
ivoks, is that hard? am i better off just biting the bullet and switching to static IP's?
Ghost is nice. backing up an open OS with proprietary software just doesn't hit me right though. - lol
jacquesmerde with dhcp-dns
metalsand: No, it's going to take one tweak.
jacquesmerde well, it isn't simple :)
metalsand: ...all the other tweaks _won't_ get it working.
jacquesmerde, how many machnes do you have on your LAN ?

Hm. will windows want to open the entire file if i pull it using FTP?
I got a deb package with synaptic, Seveas
jacquesmerde, just put your 4 machines IPs and names in /etc/hosts on each machine
metalsand, which?
wlan-ng
jacquesmerde i just know it sends public DNS, and they don't know anything about ur local network
ah
IIIEars: Dunno, that depends on the FTP client.
thoreauputic, yeah, well i'll have to set up static IP's first

jacquesmerde so, is it hotmail@hotmail.com or jacq@hotmail.com?
iwconfig eth1 commit
Now I'm frightened to use WEP using Linux, I don't want to break anything.
the latter
jacquesmerde,  man interfaces
jacquesmerde so.. it's allways username@hostname
jacquesmerde localhost IS hostname
and then try iwconfig eth1
and paste the result in a private chat
jacquesmerde it's a special hostname, referring to local host :)
Seveas: done
jacquesmerde in /etc/hosts u need something like:
jacquesmerde 192.168.0.2 gaetway
metalsand, except that i didn't get the private chat :)
jacquesmerde 192.168.0.4 mywindowsbox
ivoks, but that's for static IP
jacquesmerde etc... then will ping gateway work

why you want kubuntu da_bon_bon

da_bon_bon: also, it's a bit rich complaining that a company on the other side of the world won't ship you things for free

I keep hearing that - just a little timid to change install programs - what if i get soe type of error - it isn't easy being new to linux.
is there anyone who has any power over Ubuntu?  The documentation is the worst I have ever seen!  And plus, when you first start out, it just tells you to download the images, select "install" on a drive, and then leaves you to it...

Can someone explain to me why I'm unable to resolve dns names when my /etc/resolv.conf is correct ?

is there an OFFICIAL guide that tells you how to use apt-get properly for this OS?  I can't get w32codecs to install or get recognized using apt-get
the unofficial guide tells me to change around all my files without any explanation whatsoever
that's the wrong question
thoreauputic: does it have to run in a host window, or can it work within a window manager?
jsgottangco - Will Ubuntu "Breezy" include the no execute "NX" memory flag?
sjohnson, for w32codecs you'll need the MArillat repos
not the marillat thing again
:(
sjohnson, how about this: http://ubuntuguide.org/
sjohnson, its the unoffical one but pretty good

Rattboi, it can run nested or on its own display - it runs better on its own tty ( usually defaults to tty8)
sorry dudes if i'm sounding really pissed off, but tiny thigns like these are really frustrating.. it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence

in other words, what UbuntuGuide says to look for, is not searchable.. it's different

why not just get the tarball from mplayer
sjohnson: download that file, and run 'sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb'.
sjohnosn - relax, I have less than two weeks using linux and if i can do it you can too. :)
IIIEars: thanks bro
bob2, actually I found the "unstable" marillat version works fine: but disabling marillat in sources.list afterwrds seems to solve other issues
it can make mplayer uninstallable
bob2, hmm - I installed the multiverse mplayer afterwards: but as I say, I commented marillat out before installing it and after installing the codecs
yes
that will work
i think it might be because I'm from Canada, the config files are very different than listed in the UbuntuGuide
they will be almost identical
sjohnson, which config files?
maybe /etc/apt/sources.list
it could use ca.archive.ubuntu.com

Chris_ubuntu - you will use this disk for storage? - if you need storage and it is formatted for a correct file type windows will see it.
how do I make a dir in computer ?
dabaSlon: Windows?  This is a ubuntu box.
metalsand2: are you running 0.2.1-pre26? I never saw absolute confirmation from you.
sudo mount /dev/hd1 /media/relmp3/
crimsun: That's what I installed from
chris, you worry too much, for one, you will have a haeart attack...
second, I was speaking to IIIEars
I know I unziped that file, went to that directory and made the module from that directory
nothing related to youl
metalsand2: if you can confirm from the filename, fine.

sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/relmp3/
dabaSlon: Well, should I be able to see this disk space now?  And where?
I want to make a folder in that place
copy and paste those into your terminal.
Chris_ubuntu - you won't need a bootable parttion to use that drive as storage. format it in a filetype that the OS you choose will understand and you're done. - :)
but I don't know waht dir is the Places - Computer
ok, you need tro be root to do that, ryman,..
what folders does it have>?
etc, home, var, usr, and so on?
CD ROM Drive, floppy ...
filesystem
no, that is where you mount...
IIIEars: I formated it in a Linux file sys, but can't see it anywhere.  How would I drag a file to it?
cant make a folder there, why do you want to?

i want to mount my second HD there

I can't remember, and I'm not booted to Ubuntu atm lol
okay - do you know if it has been mounted (erm -- Ubuntu is using it?)

how would eh know?

right, asking for a password?
perhaps?

Wow! - crimsun is usually very reserved.

eob84: no, the whole error, to #flood
hello everyone, don't need help just thought I would check out the room.

Burgundavia, Seveas, what qualifies as spam in your opinion
bob2: does 'vesa'-mode even support dual screen?

sorry
metalsand eth0? isn't your wlan on wlan0?
kismet is trying to run off of eth0, not wlan0 it seems
metalsand configure kismet
bye all
Yeah, I've never bothered trying to run it since my card never worked

how to install... Im really a neeb....

helloyo, did u check /etc/fstab and dmesg
geoffroy_, this has changed in hoary
its already cracked REdz
oh ?
and is ur usb working helloyo
lewwy, ok
i just run it, and it tries to init, and then dies
REdz, dmesg says that it found a removable scsi disk sda at scsi0
could the fact that im running it on RO filesystem affect it?
helloyo, thats a good thing, wat about fstab
doesn't say anything about it
lewwy, ye i read up on that at some places for diablo2
not sure if its related
mmm
is captive-ntfs supposed to support r/w
REdz, no entry for it in fstab
helloyo, well ye u prob need that in there first
and install some of those tools and start up k3b after that
Can't I had my first user to sudoers ?
your first user (the one you create on install) is in sudoers
that is the problem
u dont want it in sudoers?
My first user, the one I created during install doesnt appear in sudoers file
oh buggery
Sorry, user geoffroy may not run sudo on
hey is there anyway i can possibly force an unmount of a cd drive?
heh
good one jeff
umount -f /mnt/cdrom0
-f forces
from the terminal ofcourse
=== ermanox [~ermanox@adsl-63-204-132-93.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net]  has joined #ubuntu
argh linux seems to pussy foot around the fact of unmounting cd drives
if its mounted and semi in use
you cant eject it
i never seem to have a problem
why can windows do this so easily?
no, im in the middle of a raven shield install
i ran cedega Setup.exe
Could you paste your file /etc/sudoers please ?
windows doesnt take control of the cdrom
linux appears to take control of it at a more hardware level
but...whats the benefit of that?
nfi, it just works for me
and why can't i just say "i really need that CD, emergency eject"
the only rare case i use umount -f is when i incorrectly burn a CD
yeh
but i got an install running off the CD
and it wont take it
Ok I think that it works
how can i config the pass for sudo ?
cuz he doesn't ask me the password
=== hno73 [~hno73@henrik.gotadsl.co.uk]  has joined #ubuntu

have you entered it within the last 15 minutes?
=== pokute_ is now known as pokute
my first user wasn't in sudoers file
=== pokute is now known as pokute_
so i wrote (with visudo) geoffroy ALL=(ALL)  ALL
so the pass isnt needed
as for root account.
I just want that when i want to change something in system configuration or anything else, it asks me a password

dabaSlon_slp: wow, you're up this late?
hey can i force cedega to release a cd-drive?
so i can unmount it?
lewwy, dont know, but you might be able to use the command "sudo eject"
nah
that ejects the bottom drive

yup.half slp...

lampshade,  brown bg and mouse pointer
HandyMicky:  I would think it would be ok for that.  the 300 could web browse so  I'd assume just routing packets would be ok.  You can install just the base with no extras and that would make the system nice and tiny

weird world eh benplaut
crimsun, I think it might be a memory leak issue with X.
At least one person in #linuxhelp tried to help me.
theres two source packages
ompaul hmm, yes i think that is closer to experience
I have (K)ubuntu system with both KDE and Gnome installed. I use KDE by default.  However, I just noticed that the Switch User option is suddenly missing from my K Menu.
shinu: perhaps you should also unload modules depending on <module_you_try_to_remove>
uh...
alright...
ill try that
crimsun, I pasted a link to a bugzilla entry that may be similar
psychonate no, i haven't had this experience
pusling: but if i reload them later my cdrom will be working fine again right?

=== ompaul goes in search of the strange bits and bytes
ompaul ouch. let's hope you're not running a journaled fs ;)
delire, like I would not do that ...
crimsun, I don't doubt the possibility., and your guess is probably better than mine, but if I close all the apps running in X, it looks like the problem still stands until I restart the X server. I don't know if that helps you at all.

pedlar amd64 is not as well supported as some other platforms just yet.

does that mean that i can't rip mp3's

pedlar: trust me it gets easyer the more you use it

i'm sure
does that mean i can do TEXT = `url_encode $TEXT`
 or it has to be TEXT = `url_encode [$TEXT] `
pedlar: Ubuntu doesn't actively support non-free proprietary codecs like mp3, and for good reason. if you want a mainstream distribution that does, see mepis.org. it all works out of the box, but is ethically unsound.
will it be possible for me to build gstreamer after that?

I'm trying to set up kernel 2.6.11 with the latest fglrx drivers with alien... but it keeps going to mesa... by any chance would any of you know why?
crimsun: oh!
one second
Chislon: you've pretty much nailed it.
johnnyfav: you can use a knoppix cd too... run grub and then 2 lines: root(hd0,0)... setup(hd0) (i think)... with the correct partitions etc...
kurt__: whats in your xorg.conf?
delire, ok thank you, do you know a good place to read those differences for the package management?
Chislon: distrowatch.org? maybe
disasm: it's pretty much default
kurt__: and why are you using alien?
nalioth, ok thank you
Chislon: there are only a small number (comparitively speaking) of applications which are not available across all distributions.
because the fglrx driver doesn't work for 2.6.11 afaik?
delire: the problem I'm having is that I need to run wpa_supplicant and then reset my wlan0 after boot up; the result is that the network interface formatting on boot is just wasting time (especially the clock setting since that needs to happen after wpa_supplicant and resetting the wlan0 is done). I figured if I could move them out the startup and build a quick sh script, I'd be ahead of the game. Ideas or suggestions?
crimsun: ah yes i see it now
johnnyfav: it'll use your /etc/grub.conf from wherever you set the root
i heard that ubuntu is new, but its like relativly new in temrs of the other distros i take it? because i also thought i heard its been around more than a year
kurt is ready for an adventure
indeed.
delire, and then is there an equivalent application available for the distro that the specific app might not work for?
crimsun: the documentation is saying to install the prerequisite packages: build essential kernel-headers-$version, where can i get that file from?
kurt__: ah, i'm using a 2.6.10 so that might be true
Chislon: the differences really are between package managers, not pacakge types per se. emerge == gentoo, apt == debian (and derivatives like ubuntu), rpm == redhat (and derivatives like Mandrake)
toxicfume: you already have those
Chislon: ubuntu is very user friendly & very user supported
toxicfume: (Ubuntu uses linux-headers, not kernel-headers)
crimsun: ah okay
kurt__: if it's going to mesa, it's probly because your xorg.conf is saying ati for driver and not fglrx

breezy is supposed to be borked

so thats why its called open source because ur using the source adn the others are using packages... ok..  and to find out the differences between these types adn the difference between doing a binary package adn source, distrowatch.org is ag ood place?

matteorox, do you know about the universe and multiverse repositories ?
Amaranth, really ?
chislon: open source means the source code is available to anyone... the package management systems aren't strictly intertwined with the license the packages are governed by
Anyone interested in an operating system wich only prints test pages? It's free.
Amaranth: not even deb-src repos?
does anyone know how large the default ubuntu installation is?  I searched the ubuntu website but couldn't find a good system requirements page.
yea
hello...can anyone help me with an sound problem ?
GammaRay: dpkg is used by apt
LinuxJones, nope..what is it ?
I used the ubuntu one
kbrooks: so?
nalioth: those should be fine, as long as your just getting the source and not building them blindly
Will Ubuntu work well on a 5 GB partition?
LinuxJones, where can i find information about ?
knoppix: less than 3.5
kbrooks: I never said it was not
tiefox, giving us some more detailed information would help us ;]

i think i understand the basic concept, but im not an expert, open source, anyone can look at it, free as in freedom of speech not as in price tag, ability to see and modify and use source as you like
adam: /join #cedega
toxicfume: hmm, it should be looking for linux-headers, not kernel-headers
GammaRay: yes.
matteorox, basically it's a whole bunch of packages. Most of the software in Debian is in those repos
kbrooks: comparing apt to rpm is wrong. comparing it to urpmi makes more sense
spanglesontoast: you need to purge that old xorg package and reinstall the ati fglrx deb you made.
Is a 5 gb partition too small for a 3.5 GB installation?  Is there a way to make it smaller while still keeping Gnome?
ok thx
LinuxJones: most=all, afaik
spanglesontoast: sadly i have to go, it's very very late here.
kbrooks: afterall there *is* an apt for rpm

i just upgraded it to an ABIT motherboar with via ac97  ( via82xx ) onboard sound
Amaranth: he isnt arguing.
realtek ac97 my sub works hehe!
crimsun: but still, i don't have any file or folder with the name linux-headers in /usr/src/
kbrooks: what are you talking about then?
LinuxJones, ok thanks..now i'll read
kbrooks, I was trying to make it as easy to understand as possible :)
now my sound comes with a lot of noise and bad quality... ( im sure that this new motherboard is OK...was just running it on slackware  )
tiefox: my via ac97 works perfectly
toxicfume: did you install linux-headers-$(uname -r) like I said?
Amaranth: pleasse dont  butt in. we're talking about ..... well, dpkg == rpm etc
crimsun: i thought i did, let me try again
kbrooks: Trying to decide if I should make you stop or not.
crimsun: whats the command again? or could i get it from synaptics?
-s

okay
I was wondering if it could be a problem from changing motherboards without reinstalling ubuntu...

Does anyone have any tips for burning an audio cd out of mp3s?
like i dint know if you were still wnating to pm me is what i mean

brb
breezy will have a new GNOME audio cd burner that rocks
do I get that via synaptic
japoeder: you'll need the k3b-mp3 package as well
the problem is bad sound quality with a lot of static

tiefox: your Master and PCM levels are up really high - too high, in fact
toxicfume: correct. Remember dependencies work top-down
Chislon: apt relies on the "low level" program, dpkg.
crimsun: okay, and then after that, how do i load the new drives? modprobe ipw2200?
toxicfume: did you install the new ipw2200 driver deb?
I put up this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=39379 it is the same problem i have in all distributions not just breezy

can i blindly trust the packages in uni and multiverse?
crumsun: i was using this high with the other motherboard...i got my sound card plugged into my stereo ..and i control the sound throught the stereo

kbrook, meaning if you do apt-get tuxracer it will find, download, and install it?  like the port for bsd? are rpm or source different from this, how does it find where tod ownload it form?
bolivar: but I'd certainly trust them a lot more than packages from external repos
benplaut: thanks I think thats whats wrong too... do you know anyone who could help ??

does anyone knows how to fix CUPS?
Chislon: rpm (the program) takes a PATH to a rpm.
bolivar: but you can use them, and get help on irc
toxicfume: once you unload all the modules related to ipw2200 and its dependencies
kbrooks, i dont know the difference between that and waht you jsut said to me
Chislon: then it installs it.
crimsun: okay, i guess i've done that :)
the support isnt an issue.  just not desiring anything 'hiding' in the package
bolivar: yes, you can trust them in that sense.
ok very good
Chislon: apt and rpm are different  in that apt searches and uses a program internally
thanks a bunch
Chislon: if you go to www.tldp.org you will find a wealth of info on how linux works (rpm, apt, etc)
Chislon: rpm takes an argument. rpm /path/to/rpm.rpm

good, I expected you would.

Dvondrake, you just need to free up some space on your system's hard drive if there isn't any available right now
does ubuntu prohibit you from editing certain files? lol
_Church_of_Foamy: mount points are flexible
i can use a different WM right?
benplaut: if i try to get rid of the other wireless card would that help ?
is dashboard similar to beagle??
ok, thanks
anything that's in the Debian apt system?

great!! :)
sinope[crashed] : tuxracer, you name it
CiRkiT, yeah :)
kbrooks, i was thinking more like TeX and ion3
(i'm not saying i will, but..) is it easy to uninstall ubuntu and go back to windows?

i just want to make sure
ummm
i'm kinda paranoid of that >.<
Dvondrake: there is!

Dvondrake: BACKUP YOUR DATA
haha, yeah

does anyone here syncs with the treo 650
so ubuntu is totally safe, and even a newb can install it with no problems, right?

or anyone knows about acpid and acpi-support
hello.  on boot-up, a check of the root filesystem was done (i had that countdown that tells you it will check in 'x' mounts) and errors were found. i ran fsck. and a lot of errors were found.  i said yes to all the fixes and everything seems normal.  question: why did it find errors?  afaik, i haven't done anything risky (haven't updated kernel or anything).
background: i reinstalled ubuntu about 3 weeks ago becuase dpkg, among other things was borked.  i was prompted to run fsck on bootup, and i said yes to all the fixes.  upon loading gnome however, nautilus sorted my folders strangely, so i just reinstalled to fix everything.  so the system now should be clean.  i don't understand [1]  why i needed to fsck in the first place. [2]  where the errors are coming from

what is gdm's equivalent to xdm's /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers ?

i have just tried the hoary live cd in a new pc i just bought
and the resolution of the screen is really poor
jason, are you sure that linux-xxxx points to the sources of your currently running kernel?
which one was built for the 2.4 kernel? the module im installing?
and the config of the frecuency rate is wrong
or the make package?

its not an nvidea

can anyone help me in pvt?
it should output the ff: hello world
the actual line in code is: len = sprintf(page, "hello world\n"
i dont really care about it right now cause i wont use the x server... but just wondering if i ever have to use it
MaRcIo, we are a help channel, so you get help in the channel :)
BockBilbo: yes, as I said, with a small amount of fiddling
BockBilbo: it will work out of the box when hoary gets a new X server soon, I think
jason, ehmm

i see
jason: please run the command
the partition program doesn't see my partitions
yo by upgrading the system it will work in the future
right?
i have mdk swap e windows
*so

i'd like to remove mdk to put ubuntu
guys i cant print out the actual output because i cant even insmod it...
great

if you meant the error wait...

 Is there anyway to have some persistant data stay around when using the live cd?  either by accessing the hd, or a USB key or some such.  I want to play around with subversion, and would like to get away with not doing a full install if I can.

alguien me podria facilitar unos repositorios deb, para la ubuntu hoary ??
jason, in a sudo -s shell you can still use sudo
oh i must be mistaken, i think its perl im talking about
jason, by the way: better use sudo -i instead of sudo -s
bob2, Yes, but the svn server I plan on implementing on Linux.  I just want to mess with it so I don't break a live system
rabo, deb  http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/ubuntu-backports/ hoary-extras main universe multiverse restricted
rabo, va en #ubuntu-es por espaol
deathwing: perl is even less like C++
perl != C++
Balthazar: ok
ok will do... please have a look at flood
i saw perl scripting looks more like c++
deathwing, ehm....
I want to completley remove OpenOffice 1.13 and I want to download and install the new OpenOffice 1.9.+ Beta, How would i go about doing this? Synaptic?

Xnalz, just ask :)
jason: that is bizaare
no
ok

Hello. I am trying to compile some Fortran 77 code that uses the blas library. I have the library installed (using atlas) and there is a file named /usr/lib/libblas.so.3. Howeer, g77 complains that it can't find -lblas library. What may be wrong?
_kevin, aptitude install openoffice.org2
well im not familiar with perl and phyton hehehe
jason: yes, I know, that is bizarre
but ive seen perl scripting
bob2 what's your exact Ubuntu config?

Chetic: ask on the mailing list
Chetic: and mention everything you've done so far
will it install over the 1.13, i don't want space to be used up by haveing two versions installed
_kevin: then install it
deathwing, Python is pretty cool.  and Ruby is beautiful.  You should learn one.
=== Balthazar [~Tim@24.70.172.248]  has left #ubuntu []

_kevin: so remove openoffice 1 if you don't want it
it goes to the please wait.... and then eventually everything turns black
jason: no, 2.6.10
bob2 default hoary runs 2.6.8.1 kernel?

_kevin: how do you normally install and remove things?
bob2 so i should be able to do the labs in hoary?
ive done some websites using php and pg sql
i don't
I have tried 4 different burned cds, and 2 different downloads
deathwing: python is simple if you know how to program in anything
deathwing, I use python for web programming
nothing is working
i install with apt-get
_kevin: you've never ever removed or installed a package?
deathwing: Actually Python is well known for being easy for beginers.
<---  2.6.10-5
fromt he ubuntu guide
_kevin: so, use apt-get to remove it
i never uninstalled anything
jason: sure
python is super easy.  Ruby not as much.
jason: you won't be able to transfer binaries from hoary to warty, but your source should certainly compile
well but most of the opensource projects i download and use is written in php
i need the name of the package to remove it

Funraiser: yeah but thuy made  a different thinger mfor it BECAUSE of the problems of installing Gnome and KDE together
madsen: So you still have the extensions etc?
zhukov, i have no problem with anything.. right now i am using xfce4
zhukov: I run gnome everywhere.. minimalist interface..
Max, from ubuntu gnome i did apt-get install kubuntu i think
:
Funraiser: therefore installing KDE under Ubuntu != Kubuntu
:
zhukov: KDE is good for Windows cronies.. :)
damn keyboard ;MMNHOHmkjmnjm
:)
Funraiser, okay..
podge: yup!
ah!
Hmm well I see one upside to KDE
podge: But yeah, indeed odd...
zhukov, cool down dude
podge, cronies?
Linforcer, well someone told me it was safe to install Kubuntu form ubuntu so i did it
madsen: I have trouble understanding how the system firefox install was corrupted...
Linforcer, but funny stuff happened since
he means cousines
can i share a great article i found? From PC World, 30 Things You Didn't Know You Could Do on the Internet. http://www.pcworld.com/resource/printable/article/0,aid,120784,00.asp Do you know of "other things you didn't know could be done on the internet"
Funraiser: maybe it is supposed to be in Hoary
Max, this keyboard only works with some punches
=== pisuke [~pisuke@84-120-64-81.onocable.ono.com]  has left #ubuntu []
podge: Yeah, me too.
let me know what you think of the article.
Funraiser: I just remember in Warty it did weeeeird things with sound
zhukov, then u must have good meals..lol
Linforcer, like kde windows opening in gnome...:-(
zhukov: http://www.google.com.au/search?q=define+cronies&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial
podge: It might have something to do with my X crashing. (That's when it stopped working.)
heh
anyway... The only thing about Kd I like is Konqueror
podge: I'm playing with the composite extension and stuff and it _is_ pretty unstable after all...
minus the web abilities that is
=== cpop [~korn@213.157.164.98]  has joined #ubuntu
okay zhukov tell me why do u hate KDE?
I had konqueror opening without asking in ubuntu
madsen: Doing your own extension work?
Linforcer: KWord is alright too.
it's imo a much better file browser than nautilus
now i have no firefox...
podge: No, just messing around with drop-shadows in Xorg and stuff.
madsen: Cool.. looks good no doubt (when it is running)..
what is the downloading size of KDE???
I'm planning on using fluxbox once I've made my switch to gentoo anyway
madsen: any screenshots?
Max, i dunno...it seems all so...fragile. So like all is going down if I sneeze
podge: It runs alright here, but it is a bit unstable.
podge: I can make you one, just a sec.
Max, i think you should at least try KDE, personnaly i prefer gnome, KDE is too MS-windows-like to me
and i dont like crystal.and i hate the bar
yes
zhukov, haaatchooooo!
Funraiser: what about KDE is like Windows?
:D
Funraiser, yeah thats waht its aim was
and it;s broken :)

no idea
purely because it is so configurable..
and i came across ubuntu because o gdesklets :D
*of
zhukov: Desklets are cool..
i love ubuntu
podge, when they work
Max:  I get 422 MB
Funraiser: yep..
right after warty came out, i installed hoary :D I was using suse, but suse is mainly kde, and i wanted the gdesklets bar :) MacOs freak back then...
Max:  152 MB download

zhukov, okay
zhukov: I used SuSE first too... I hate it. but if you could get Novell Linux Desktop which basically is SuSE with Gnome and a Novell theme
Max, gdesklets make your desktop look really cool have a look (and it's useful too) http://www.lynucs.org/?gdesklets
today i got free cds of ubuntu... 5 months after i ordered...lol
i already downloaded 2 releases
lol

the data messes in up
=== Funraiser thinks Seveas is very quiet
since the new versions use "controls" rather tha sensors
or was that ermmmm
displays rather than sensors
I think the former
madsen: Do any other window managers have that feature?
Has anyone tried aDesklets?
nope
Funraiser, i am using xfce not GNOME
oh
xfce eeew\
podge: Well, the feature is implemented in Xorg and the WMs can utilize it... So basically all WMs have it...
xffm is an abomonation
Max, dunno then if it's the same or not

but its faster
because at the friend where I used it it didn't anywhere
also xffm is awful

podge: Denmark, why?
brezzy will have them

madsen: It's not filled out in your profile.. :)

will breezy also have a splash screen for grub?
now i want to give away my linux cds to my friends
madsen: When I right click on your IRC username..

as well as (not conifrmed) some sort of expose and that sleek animation of the window minimizing to the bar  la mac os :D

new software, perhaps?
cpop, from the next version on you can use mirrors for debian stable again
madsen: Those wobbly windows are pretty cool!
Is it OK to and how do I install the kernel package from breezy on my hoary system?
cpop: sensible defaults to the ends of desktop use.
cpop, see www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship for all the info

nalioth, hello. nice to hear from you again. thank you for  "commenting in". in what kind of circumstances do you think one needs the source repos?
bigfoot1: it's good to get into the habit of commenting out that which you don't need. leave yourself little commented notes (comments) also.
bigfoot1: and in any case, they are not doing any harm in the txt file, since they are only used when you ask apt t0 build from source
when is it necessary to build from source?
bigfoot1: there are some binaries (esp on amd64 and ppc arches) not available. so on those platforms, building from deb-src archives gets you a 'home-rolled' ubuntu packaged binary

nalioth, i asked in #debian if the performance increase was worth it and i was told it was but it seems the amd64 ports are missing quite a few packages I use often. debian doesn't have OO ported yet, and ubuntu doesn't have mplayer
jasoncohen: are you familiar with apt-gets capabilitys?
yes
jasoncohen: uff, if mplayer is not in ubuntus repos, it does not prevent you from adding some extra repos
blocking complete ip-ranges can cost you a lot of customers if you running a site for business purposes

they can do it
bob2:so should i use sdl or xwindows?
thechitowncubs: and I'd like wings so I could fly
anyways, is there any way i can not load grub on bootup, and reinstall ubuntu
but a new user would probably go the easy route and use synaptic
i just don't understand it, i have been using ubuntu and think its great for a long time
thechitowncubs, that is why you wait for your vendor (Ubuntu) to patch
RichardC: doesn't really matter, I think SDL will use the exact same output method as X Windows in that case
is there anyway I can stop Media change: please insert the disc labeled
 'Ubuntu 5.04 _Hoary Hedgehog_ - Release i386 (20050407)'
in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter
from coming up
every time I try to install something
thechitowncubs: it's trivial if you want it, setup firefox to install .debs when you click on them, or use autopackage
gp_aaron|upstair, lauch synaptic and remove the cdrom
I guess that makes since, but what about software that isn't in the repos and requires to be built from source
=== zyxxyx [~piespy@dsl-209-205-185-58.i-55.com]  has joined #ubuntu
thechitowncubs: but it's a terrible idea, since it encourages people to install random, broken junk
what is the installion model for that
edit the apt.cources gp_aaron|upstair  and comment out the cdrom line is another way. :P first line i think.
'going to websites' to get stuff is for people without package managers. If a user doesn't want to trust the pkgmanager, they should use something like slackware
Burgundavia, it is a server install, no synaptic

=== Dr_Willis guesses theres A reason...
:P
Trackilizer: if you are having problems getting extensions, about:config in the location bar, look for 'vendorSub', and change the version
if the next ubuntu rls came tommorrow would i have to reinstall the whole thing?
The user wants freedom, and being held down by the software available to them provided by their vendor just seems ridiculous.
other than that, security stuff is done by people who get paid to keep you safe
You're not being held down
You're just being asked to rtfm before doing it
I perfer security in my os.. vs.. ease to install any random program.
thechitowncubs: they have freedom
i can wait a week or 2 for official updates.
thechitowncubs, you are free to break you package management system. Just don't expect support when you do
given the amount of stuff in Ubuntu repos, it's hard to describe it as "being held down", really
I have Grub installed and have 3 hard drives (windows | storage drive | ubuntu | dvd-rw).  My second hard drive which is my 'storage drive' has died and I had to remove it.  So now I have (windows | empty | ubuntu | dvd-rw).  Now since I have my storage drive disconnected I get a 'GRUB ERROR 21'.  How can I fix this?  I chroot to my /dev/hdc1 which is ubuntu through Knoppix and now what do I...

when is it coming?

uhh... guys sorry to ask this but if I want to compile a file I would need to run 'apt-get install build-common' right?
Trackilizer - there isn't a single thing you it seems you can't change the look of in gnome. install an app in gnome and if it needs a kde lib aptittude or synaptic will resolve dependency issues in one click and they run.
that is befor I could compile it
so no one can help me with  my hard drive? is that really such a stupid question to ask that  no one answers?

Trackilizer - Windows has a lo-ong way to go in being as customisable. window transparency is just one item in a long list of neat tweaks that can be done without any nerdy text editing.
how do i dix that

vladuz976: what're you trying to do?
Madpilot: just add a second hd for storage. i tried "cfdisk /dev/hdd" but get fatal error
Trackilizer  -  add an image background to a window or make it tiled, translucent or with alltray make the borders disappear.
Madpilot: then did same with hdd1 no error. why won't it work for the volume?
guys, what do i have to search for in synaptic to download the kernel sources
/bin/sh: line 1: gcc: command not found
/bin/sh: line 1: gcc: command not found
Trackilizer - Graphic Image Manipulation Program (Think Photo Shop) is installed you can just about anything.

daves, have you installed gstreamer0.8-mad?
jurgonh, right click and choose properties

how ? this is very much a new install (gstreamer0.8-mad - think so if it's done by default)
daves, it is not done by default
Thx =)

that way you can boot into what you need and you get to still play with ubuntu
HappyFool, could I install 32-bit?
v1ru5, in the console, simply type: sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop

anyhow, how do i add people to sudo list?
skyhawker: well, despite the opinion of others here ;) i'd considering have a dual-boot system
v1ru5: do you have a root password? did you enter one during install?
cause when i give sudo my pass it just says that my login is not in the sudo list
yeah i have it
but sudo apparently doesn't want it
v1ru5: then use 'su -c <command>' instead
just says that wrong password byebye
v1ru5: entering the root password
anyone using skype ?
can't i just change to root and run aptitude without the sudo
?
v1ru5: because sudo wants your user passwd
v1ru5: you can add yourself to the sudo list by doing something like 'EDITOR=gedit su -c visudo /etc/sudoers'
Hey just a simple question how do you open a tgz.gpg file ?
HappyFool, ha I've had that before and don't particularly like that method, I did have Fedora Core 4 installed on a VMWare virtual drive when I was on XP, but I'm trying to stay away from the windows installation
http://www.newsforge.com/articles/05/07/19/1824234.shtml?tid=149  <-- heh, love that article
skyhawker: i didn't mean vmware, but actual dual-booting. anyway, if you're happy with 32-bit linux, go for it. i'd first check that whether your apps work with wine or not

is there any way to find out what's keeping my cdrom from ejecting?
google for an old trial of vmware on someones anon ftp and you will find one. i sent an email to vmware noticing one once, and they just told me it was perfectly legal - even tho the keygen was sitting next to it. so with their blessing, i used it...
darkmatter, :)

Hey just a simple question how do you open a tgz.gpg file ?
HappyFool, ok so I'll go and format :( godamn I do that too much..

well good luck!
Hi all. How come I can only read my mounted windows partition using "sudo".. It says that the owner is "root" and chmod'ing it doesn't work...
HappyFool: same here
i'm not complaining ;) this is just the way linux (or ubuntu) currently works
sylvan: specify another owner in fstab
sylvan: can't remeber how you do that thoufg
how? /dev/sdb5	/mnt/winxp_scratch	ntfs	rw,auto,user 0 0
*though
sylvan: add a umask=000 option
ok, will try
sylvan: so 'rw,auto,umask=000'
HappyFool, ro
I'm not complaining either. Maybe I'm just weird, but I actually like it that way:D
on ntfs?
ntfs writing is not possible :)
is ro anyway *shrug*
oh
right, sorry
yeah :)
more thinking, less typing
no matter what you do, write bits won't be set :)
what does "user 0 0" do?
i think 'user' means any normal user can mount the device
sylvan: user says anyone can mount/unmount it, and the 0 0 are the fsck sequencing, since ntfs isn't fsck'ed, its 0 0
hmm..  well that's strange since that's precisely what doesn't happen =) I can not reach it as "sylvan" but I can reach if I sudo
sylvan, it talks about *mounting* not about reading from it...
sylvan: but it's mounted for you on boot, by root
auto,ro,umask=0000 will make it readable by anyone
ah.. so umask=000 sets read permissions?
okay, thanks!
=== Safari_Al [~tr@ppp239-31.lns2.adl2.internode.on.net]  has joined #ubuntu
auto,ro,user,umask=0000 will make it appear on the places menu
sylvan: I have set /dev/hda1       /windows        ntfs    noauto,ro,users,umask=022 0 0
one more question, uid=1000 and gid=1000 appears on another mounted disk, what does that mean?
FWIW
022?
sylvan, that means that uid 1000 will be listed as owner
meanin?
sylvan: because it's read-only
and 022 is effectively the same as 000 on ntfs
ok
uid 1000 (user id 1000) is probably you
Seveas: true
okay.. I'll try this and see if it works.. thanks!
btw, i upgraded firefox to the latest, and it's fine; i only have the adblock extension
it says that "line 10 in fstab is bad" /dev/sda1	/mnt/winxp_system	ntfs	ro,auto,user 0 0,umask=000
=== millennuimdark [~millennui@218.104.46.221]  has joined #ubuntu
hi anybody, would one install cpanel as root user or regular user on their server?
the umask=000 needs to come after user, and before the 0   0
sylvan: wrong order
ah..
looks like its working! thanks!

how do I get DivX working in ubuntu?

okay, another quick question. In Mplayer (just using applications->sound &video -> mplayer), how can I watch something fullscreen? If I right click and select fullscreen mplaye does cover the screen, but the video is still the same size with black borders around
google : ubuntu divx :/
linuxboy: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
I'm pretty sure the FAQ links to that
the mkfontdir bin isn't being found while upgrading from hoary to breezy
sylvan: that sounds like mplayer is using the X11 driver, change mplayer to use 'xv' as the output method

nikkia: do you think other than fucking stuff up yourself, having cpanel in root carries other dangerous?
bob2, will it work?
nikkia: *dangers
pvanhoof: no
sylvan: mplayer.conf in /etc/mplayer
vladuz976: yes
bob2, do you perhaps know how I can read filesystem labels..?
nikkia: like?
pvanhoof: read the topic, for instance
bob2, can one get it to work?
Seveas: tune2fs
vladuz976: cpanel has modules for accessing files, letting root do that is really bad

=== AlexBO [~Alessandr@adsl-35-16.37-151.net24.it]  has joined #ubuntu
vladuz976: that said, if apache uses chroot (i don't think it does...) then the damage would be limited to www-root....
so should I still have x11 as video driver?
can you advice me a program to change the wallpaper at regular intervals?
bob2, assuming I am a highly experienced developer, can I get it to work after some specific tweaks? or is it totally broken (as in: reinstalling everything would take less time)
linuxboy: you should install the codes
vladuz976: because there are potential exploits that could do bad things by giving public root access to the filesystem, even if it is 'abstracted' as just files below www-root
pvanhoof: if you're a highly experienced ubuntu or debian developer, you can get it working, yes
sylvan: dunno - I just set "zoom" and it worked - YMMV
=== gremid [~gremid@p54BD8BC8.dip0.t-ipconnect.de]  has joined #ubuntu
pvanhoof: that you're asking indicates that reinstalling would be easier
ok

bob2, k, thanks anyway :)

hallo
pvanhoof: reading the various bug reports and ubuntu-devel archives
vladuz976: for example, say i use ftp to create a symlink from ~/public_html/passwd to /etc/shadow   normally, while that would 'work', i wouldn't be able to read the file, but if i then use cpanel to access the filesystem, i could potentially view /etc/shadow
nikkia: probably big hassle to change everything since, it's set up already for a while
clearly you're not, tho, so it's kinda moot
warum geht mein modem nicht mit ubunto?
iZoom, #ubuntu-de fuer deutschsprachige hilfe..
bob2, clearly I've probably been developing/contributing on most of the applications that you're working with atm.
however, whether or not I'm experienced doesn't really matter
right?
which bugs are the most important ones?
I'm not trying to be an ass, sorry
=== iZoom [nobody@p54B3401B.dip.t-dialin.net]  has left #ubuntu ["Client]
but breezy is really quite fucked
vladuz976: worse, because apache/cpanel is running as root, i could perhaps even overwrite /etc/shadow with my own contents, and thus gain complete access to the system :)
daniel basically told everyone to leave him alone until next week when he can fix it
without X, breezy is reasonably fine :)
nikkia, apache running as root..?
pvanhoof: I don't know the specific bug #s, sorry
that's stupid...
ok np
Seveas: that's what vladuz976 said it is configured as
nikkia: that doesn't sound very good
I'll mainly search for bugs related to X
anyone having problems with DNS?
Seveas: yes
apache running as root is a major security error
Seveas: i can't remember if apache chroot's tho, i don't think it does...
cyphase, only in firfox :)
apche doesn't chroot
yea..
cyphase: Open firefox and go to about:config. Now search for network.dns.disableIPV6 and set that value to true. Restart Firefox to see the effect.
it's not just firefox
wget isn't working either
bob, didn't think so, it'd make handling ~/public_html very difficult unless you start a new thread/process for each URL and chroot after determining where to chroot to
cyphase, disable ipv6 completely then, that might help
pvanhoof: #ubuntu-devel might be a better place to ask, but I don't htink anyone in the know is around atm
Seveas, it was working a minute ago..
nikkia: hah, yeah
ok
cyphase, ah ok
then your dns server may simply be b0rking a bit
cyphase: maybe look for a public dns server and change /etc/resolv.conf ?
cyphase, try: dig @82.148.208.131 freenode.net
=== _Tsukasa is now known as Tsukasa
cyphase, if that works, your normal dns server is having a hickup

and I still use red hat/solaris/windows at work

vladuz976: Ubuntu is less hassle ;)
in what package can mkfontdir be found (on breezy?)
Seveas: where do you work, that they give you all that
I still use both
pvanhoof: it may not be in any package yet

I do agree there' s some package issues. mkfontdir isn' t in a package
vladuz976: nah, he's away now
going to reboot to test the new kernel (in a few minutes, first making sure everything is set correctly)
vladuz976, a control panel should not be integrated into apache but be its own web server...

pvanhoof, how'd you fix X? II've been having a heck of a time getting it going in breezy.
vladuz976, well, I still don't like these kind off applications, they are major security risks....
server admins should be able to edit config files :)
darkmatter, you basically need to get a mkfontdir binary installed (in your PATH and in /usr/X11/bin also -- symlink it --), and then dkpg-reconfigure xfonts-base
=== pho [~pho@H2db8.h.pppool.de]  has joined #ubuntu

Seveas: yeah they probably should, but this guy knows less than me about linux and is runnning fedora on his server

darkmatter, it basically fails to install mkfontdir .. and some scripts/etcetera's still have it pointed to /usr/X11/..
darkmatter, pvanhoof that just fixes it until daniels breaks something else :)
it still hasnt the permissions to write, the line looks like that:
/dev/hda8       /media/windows_i vfat auto,umask=0111,dmask=0222,fmask=0333 0 0
Seveas, yep :). So I'm going to be careful when upgrading

I has been used Slackware always

Windblows have one good feature: 1) You can unistall it!
Because I had some problems when I was running Gentoo, everything would get unbearably slow while it was writing to the hdd, but when I configured it for SATA, it worked perfectly.  I'm having some really bad slowing down now that I'm updating my packages, and it reminds me of the same problem.
lordfreak, i don't like the Skype's version for Linux
zwnj: well, "make" is GNU make (I assume that's gmake) See apt-cache show make
No much
banskuz, never knew that :P
zwnj, have you installed the build-essential package ..?
I have installed just now, But the fonts are very huge
:s anyone knows why?

Seveas: yes
Seveas: as I asked him some time ago...
zwnj, ok type this: alias gmake=make
and then retry configure
thoreauputic: i symlinked gmake to make, but it's not good that GNU Make package doesn't have gmake which many applications' build system depends on
i installed a new version of OpenOffice, and I wanted to delete the old one which was installed with ubuntu...how do i do this?
Zukalk do you know why my fonts in Linux Version of Skype are so Huge ?
lordfreak, Skype uses QT, maybe that's what causing it
Eesh, I used to be able to get answers within seconds on this channel, now it's like I'm invisible.  :(
lordfreak, try the command 'qtconfig'
zukalk .... Hummmm 1 second Im trying
zukalk, lordfreak, that is in the qt3-qtconfig package (FYI)
zwnj: anyone writing for linux who doesn't know that "make" is gmake is ... *cough* in some alternative universe, IMO
ah, thanks for clearing that up, Seveas, i couldn't remember where i got it
mozilla people doesn't write just for linux
zukalk .... qtconfig doesn't runs nothing
btw, gmake is available in many systems
so mozilla needs gmake, not linux
Does anyone know if I could add SATA support to my hot plugs?
seveas thanks
Seveas, should he install qt3-qtconfig?
zwnj: I think you missed my point - why would you assume gmake is available in linux, when commonly it is invoked with "make" and is *the same thing* ?
zukalk, well, to run qtconfig that would be neccessary
could anyone tell me how to run fdisk?
snowman1000, run it in a terminal
snowman1000, what are you trying to accomplish?
Seveas, no, but what he needs is too make the fonts smaller. is there another way of doing so?

ok
how do I install a package I have downloaded? When I do the "apt-get install <package-name" routine from the location of the file, apt says it cannot find it. I have also added the /home/boga/downloads path to the sources list.
i installed a new version of OpenOffice, and I wanted to delete the old one which was installed with ubuntu...how do i do this?
Seveas, Okay that gives me back a listing of eight pretty mundane looking variables.  Nothing to do with SATA or IDE.
zwnj: yes, i think they should send a bug report upstream - any linux user knows "make"- but gmake is kind of obscure if you aren't on unix

and that's what's so bitchy about it
debfoster?
coz i knew i didn't do anything wrong
v1ru5, then your error report is bullshit, you should have said that during install funky things happened...
and it doesn't work
you "knew"? how?

whoa :D bliss had commandline option --bliss-uninfect-files-please  which worked :D
leroj, it's a program you run from the terminal. read its manpage for more info (package debfoster)
because you can't do much errors in the default install .. or at least i didn't

thoreauputic, perhaps, but last time I installed it (admittedly a long time ago) it refused to work.  And the point is, the codecs are necessary before compiling to work, contrary to Seveas

usbstore is a kernel module, I'd guess

which is in some sense a driver

found the correct driver for linux at brother.no
=== terrex is away: Alimentndome // I'm eating st
skyhawker:  dpkg -L <packagename> | grep bin
Seveas, probably so.  I was never debating that, just that for compilation one needs the codecs pre-installed, according to mplayer.
Seveas: lol
sorry bob2 and Seveas, you were right all along
skyhawker : open a terminal and type in the name of the program you installed whilest pressing tab after every second letter you type in
the md5 is busted
=== v1ru5 bows down to Seveas and bob2
=== aspro [~gverdouw@220-253-96-174.TAS.netspace.net.au]  has joined #ubuntu
v1ru5, before trying to burn it again: check the md5sum of the iso
where does gnome store menu entries btw?
lsuactiafner: I think my solution is less trouble ;-)
and burn it at low speed (like 4x)
Seveas: so redownload..
ok
thoreauputic : yeh
Can anyone help me get a Dell printer running in Ubuntu??
lsuactiafner, slocate .desktop
mine is easier to remember
bbl
seveas: is the rationale documented somewhere. looks like an evil bug to me. i can open one file two times, make vchanges to one version, save it, the otther buffer still has the old version.
=== darkmatter [~darkmatte@206-163-248-101.yktn.hsdb.sasknet.sk.ca]  has left #Ubuntu ["Leaving"]
but dont know how to install it properly, gets this message, can only install files whith .ppd
=== kcid [~kcir@ariadne.sanguinary.net]  has joined #ubuntu
chrissturm: that's a feature
a feature in the IBM sense of it?
ping 192.168.0.145
oops :-)
hondje: its not how anyone would expect a texteditor to act
chrissturm : feature since i open a file, edit it, run changes, if broken i revert to my buffered copy
eek my banana
chrissturm: it's just the way unix works, so IBM way is exactly it :)
evening all,   totem-xine loses sound randomly on all vidoe formats,   sudo killall esd fixes it, any ideas as to why this happens.
chrissturm, I for one consider it to be a bug, but it is a feature, search domewher on the gedit site...
Wow, my first test for mplayer and mplayerplug-in packages: it crashes firefox.
squareyes : heard ubuntu had broken ac52 package..
hondje: that has nothing to do with how unix works. no text editor works that way
seveas: thx
squareyes : but i think you should run mplayer instead
mplayer -ao alsa
squareyes: because esd is pure evil ;-)
squareyes: configure xine to used esd
chrissturm : all text editors work like that in unix
chrissturm : and we prefer it like this.
lsuactiafner: you = "the unix people"
thanks lsuactiafner and bob2
"the kool-aide drinkers"
it still is a bug
i dont think kate works that way, i know jedit doesnt do it
I'd be annoyed if I could only open a file once in a text editor
chrissturm : not a bug, its a feature.
I edit the same file in multiple emacs buffers all the time
Then they're using lockfiles or something silly, vi has always done that
nuking changes is pretty dumb, tho, so that's a bug
not lockfiles, allowd you to open it twice
but you open one file, edit it then find it in an older state later back in the tabs
isnt there anyone that can help me whith my printer problem
can be quite confusing at times
=== seb128 [~seb128@ANancy-151-1-55-169.w83-194.abo.wanadoo.fr]  has joined #ubuntu
chrissturm : i sometimes open 1 file in 5 consoles and commit changes in one console while browsin up and down the file lookin @ prior revisions
drummer87: it can be, I agree
But it's not something that anyone is ever going to change
well, maybe in gedit, but it's an application thing, they're just doing what unix says is okay
=== hondje wonders if that's against the HIG
no, one just has to remember what they're working on better
and not be so forgettful
i'd rather nuke changes than nuke my backups
hondje: unix has no "opinion" how a text editor should work
=== Sionide [~sphinx@cpc4-hem12-6-0-cust227.lutn.cable.ntl.com]  has joined #ubuntu
joe does read the last modified time and warns the user that the current file is newer than the buffered file
Of course it doesn't have an actual opinion, learn colloquial english
=== eruin [~eruin@76.84-48-29.nextgentel.com]  has joined #ubuntu
chrissturm: unix people, on the other hand, have *strong* opinions on the subject :D
the operating system isn't going to say 'dont' do that', it's up to the application, and most people making unix text editors prefer it works normallly

hi all
killing changes is dumb
bleh use joe screw vi ect
bob2 : killin backups is worse
'most'
buffered backups rock.
yes, as is setting pets on fire
=== nikkia returns
thoreauputic: yeah, i figured it out already ;)
Nedit is great :p
chrissturm: you can file a bug on bugzilla.ubuntu.com
I'd sugfgest "enhancement" severity
changes you can redo, backups aint repalable.
seveas, actually, these days, unix is a set of specifications for a standard posix based system :)
lsuactiafner: that's why you should use revision control for everything
I thought unix was a name you get when you pay someone money
:)
hondje: yeah, AND you meet the set of specifications
no one is answering,really need help, if i dont get my printer to work i have to install windows again, and i dont really want that
unix dork is the name you get for debating howto commit changes.
ubuntudigger: try asking on the ubuntu-user list, it seems no one here knows the answer to your question
ubuntudigger> what is your printer anyway ?
is there anything like scan disk available fo ubuntu,

hondje: how so?
=== Miichael [Miike@c-67-170-164-124.hsd1.or.comcast.net]  has left #ubuntu []
nikkia, POSIX is the set of specifications...
not much fine tuning
nikkia, UNIX still is the At&T trademark
=== sexcopter8000m [~NNSCRIPT@82-34-47-19.cable.ubr01.chel.blueyonder.co.uk]  has joined #ubuntu
seveas, there is a further set of specs that define UNIX compliance
hondje: right, but acls are way more complicated
is there a good programmers editor for gnome?
seveas, no, 'UNIX' these days has little to do with AT&T, it is a name you can attach to your OS if you meet the UNIXxx specs
yeah, first time I tried to impliment them I died
nikkia, there are more specification sets, but none is called UNIX
hondje: unix permissions are very simple to use and manage.  if you do need some thing more complicated, tho, you can use unix acls.
Seveas: afaik UNIX is a trademark of the Open Group
sorush20 : every 20 reboots fsck/scandisk runs.. but if you kill the power to your pc linux runs a fsck in the background and ou dont notice or wait for it
thoreauputic, ah true, it's been transferred
and DO NOT run fsck on your own
bob2: I know about (and have used) acls, but it seems to me that there 'should' be some sort of medium
chrissturm: most FS programmers I know use vim or emacs
or you kill your disk easily..
=== MonsieurBon [~MonsieurB@212-41-72-177.adsl.solnet.ch]  has joined #ubuntu
hello
Seveas: TOG made it so that anyone can apply to call their system 'UNIX'
and there is the 'Singel Unix Specification' that is sort of an extended posix
and SUS is freely avilable, unlike POSIX
Seveas: basically, you need to adhere to to the specifications for the UNX95/2000 whatever specs
hi, i'm in windows at the mo. i had an empty ntfs partition, have deleted it and want to make it fat so i can share files between ubuntu and windows, but when i go through the format process, ntfs is the only option. can anyone help?
nikkia, ah, url to more info please :)
=== ztonzy [~ztonzy@ztonzy.artist.blender]  has joined #ubuntu
sexcopter8000m: you might be better off just formatting it from ubuntu then
seveas, its on TOG's website somewhere, i forget the URL
bob2: i was thinking more in the direction of something like kdevelop
seveas, there was talk about IBM paying for linux to be UNIX2000 certified
guys a number of times I have had to reinstall Ubuntu due to an error that occurs and an scan process starts but terminates and is unable to fix anything... It searches for nodes and it returns that it can not be read and do you want to force overwrite... this goes on for ever... does any one have any suggestions if this happens again...
chrissturm: there's monodevelop, but it's only for C#
eclipse is apparently nice for Java
ubuntudigger> http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/brother-list/2004q4/000839.html
I like qtdeveloper thingie, a child can make an app with that :)

=== Psystorm [~psystorm@p54966258.dip.t-dialin.net]  has joined #ubuntu
ok, if i boot into ubuntu now, i'll brb and then someone can kindly point me in the right direction :)
sorush20 : runs ext3
not ext2
hondje, and that's exactly what happend: kiddies writing KDE crap
:0
;)
sorush20: why are you having so much disk corruption?
I want to do the following: There are 1295 files in a directory, I'd like to download with wget. Can I use a for-thing to do that? or do I have to download all the files manually? the files are named 1.txt to 1295.txt
and learn fsck -a -y /dev/bleh next time youhave an ext2 error
seveas, when IBM has finally killed AIX, they will probably want to be able to claim their linux systems as 'UNIX[tm] ' so it would make sense for them to do it
MonsieurBon : i'll paste you a line to do that
bob2 I don't have any when windows is running...
Seveas: that's a good thing in my book
monsieurBon ?
more crap the merrier, people like crap :)
sorush20: are you just turning your computer off without shutting down or something?
=== Psystorm [~psystorm@p54966258.dip.t-dialin.net]  has left #ubuntu ["Verlassend"]
once you get a kid writing nonsense like I do with qtdeveloper, they're more likely to stick around making linux apps, that can only be good
Seveas: http://www.theopengroup.org/certification/unix-home.html
no.. its been left on and after a few hours it  seems to happen... and I don't know what has happend... or anything..
bob2,
seveas, basically, you pays yer money, you makes yer OS adhere to the 'single unix specification' and you get to call it UNIX :)
does any one here have an antivirus running...
nikkia, I see
you don't need antivirus software on ubuntu
woo
seveas, interestingly, i note there is a 'UNIX03' now
okay... how about firewall..
nikkia: I expect IBM will wait until the lawyers have wiped the floor with SCO ;)
sorush20: so, what exactly is happening to your system?
sorush20: it just randomly crashes?
thoreauputic: probably
guarddog is a nice firewall

bob2, yes.. it seems to randomly crash and all I see is the boot loader failing... it seems to be scanning the disk... then it fails and asks me to scan manually with the command fsck, I do this and it finds unreadable nodes and just keeps on prompting me to force overwrite..
shows how much I pay attention :)

Nard, by installing samba...

OculusAquilae, the very last finds it again

hey stupid question, i downloaded a program in b2 format, whats the install for it via command line?

a) it's probably bz2, and b) you should use apt insead.

if the package is obsolete, then i'd assume that opera would work without it
funkyHat: it's replaced by another -- libqt3-mt
cafuego_:by any chance you there?
my resolution is 640x480. how can i make 10**x7**. theres no option
apokryphos, so tell it depend on one or the other
?
!tell pc22 about resolution
pc22. modify your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
funkyHat: yes, tell it to depend on the breezy one, I don't have time to do it right now though.
ok??
ok. thanks, i'm working on it

Cesarin, breezy changes everydays
until tuntil the patches
packages.ubuntu.com is not very helpful :-(
I configured my modem for pppoe, but Ubuntu doesn't recognize it (I'm back on WinXP to ask you what to do). Help?
I installed the patches it told me to download
and BANG, restarted and now it doesnt detect my mouse
oh yeah! that was my second question: has anyone been trying Breezy on old hardware with modest specs, say, between 400 MHz and 800 MHz? I'm concerned about upgrading to GTK+ 2.8 with its new Cairo dependency, if the old machinery in this school will grind to a screeching halt.
I just want to fix it. I supose its the only problem
elad`, what kind of modem is it?
is it difficult to get wireless working with WPA (windows radius server) ?
isnt there another way?

whats the command to close x-chat-text btw?
boxerboy29: you can upgrade

it keeps giving me fatal error
cesarin,  running breezy?
"no core pointer"
breezy ate cesarin's X
I can give details on what I want, but.. pff

cesarin, breezy is development - it will break - that is the way of development - it has to be this way so that bugs are fixed for release
ompaul: well I had the mistake of burning it, thinking it was the "stable" release
cesarin, for you stable is a better bet 5.04
try "sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install udev" if the udev from your mirror is updated to the working version
ompaul: well yes
cesarin, well I suggest u get hoary and enjoy it :)

malv: i would guess so with mplayer
and the right codecs
malv, yes but you need the w32codecs
is it possible to install excel in umbunto?

Hey guys, can ANYONE tell me why i cant edit  a XORG.CONF file, when i sudo nano it acts as if there is no file there
xorg.conf
all lowercase
i knw
it's in /etc/X11R6/
er
dmlinux, generally, you want to "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
 /etc/X11
what is the firefox plugin called?
im trying to edit the xorg.conf for my input devices.
net10: you still there?
heh
malv, media player connectivity
breezy has this funky front-end on top of sysvinit
Malv there are a couple; i was thinking of the mplayer one
but I didn't get it when upgrading from hoary
it's a separate package ?
its in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
benh, it's in gnome-system-tools
tritium: not the front-end for configuring
benh, yeah...
tritium: the front-end at boot, instead of text mode, I get a gfx stuff with a progress bar

ubuntu on a nice pc lappy > ubuntu on a nice mac lappy (personally)

If I have the preview version installed and I am looking to upgrade to the real thing once it comes out, will I have to mod my apt sources at all or will it be transparent?  Like one day I just to apt-get update and upgrade and bam I have the official version?
not great either

oh, back to my question

is there a keyboard sequence to bring up the footprint menu (as well as the others)?
sure, via dpkg, it might work

hello, is there a way i can write to my ntfs drive instead of just reading fromit?
brenner: a yes, the flying cow, right ? :-D
gstar: are u running with the 686 kernel when you reinstall it?
toasters!
northern_monk: yes
right! :-)
gstar had the same problem , never got around to fixing it , when i reinstalled the driver it installed on the current kernel not the new one
fredforfaen: thanks for that.

thanks... will try re-installing kernel and driver together

zeroverse_, it is not recomended that you try to do that, if you do install something that talks to ntfs, it  may blow up the partition, it is down to MS closing and keeping closed how that filesystem
gstar: check with: updatedb & locate nvidia
s/&/&&/
eth42: apt-cache show vim and then check the dependencies, :P

hello all
grgcsmc: running a binary installer should be as easy as cd'ing into the directory and then ./<program>
i use ssh to run x applications on remote computers a lot, does anyone know if there is a way to bring an already running application onto the remote machine
im not good at code
plz pm me
SuseUX: dpkg -i
has anyone had problems where a wifi card goes down frequently with sustained heavy throughput
is there a way to define a window without borders with metacity?
so could i for example bring synaptics on a remote machine to my local machine, as you can not run it twice
grgcsmc: it's a binary, you just run it like any windows installer
Oly_mk2: not with SSH
grgcsmc: what topyli  said....it will start a graphical installer iirc
okay shame
and ssh -X is slow
wont open
=== topyli leaves for sauna
just seems silly killing the application and relaunching it
grgcsmc: what's the error
you might want to try VNC
djm62: I think <djm62> just had those problems.
can someone tell me what the "GNONLIN_LIBS" are and why isnt "gnonlin" in the ubuntu apt repos?

yeah i have vnc and freenx setup

is it integrated into breezy?
works nicely in breezy :)
boxerboy29: i entered a word into beagle and it gave me messages from my instant messenger ehre i mentioned that word :)
Chousuke: 'integrated' -> no
I can't get it installed, pain in the arse with all the dependancies
Chousuke: its packaged for ubuntu tho
only problem is i use reiserfs as my file system :/
Chousuke: by integrated i mean in the menu etc
I really can't wait for that ubuntu release which has eveything finally integrated and working.
Chousuke: breezy has lotsa new stuff
it's not breezy, nor will it be Dapper.
it throws error out something like an illegal code in line 119 it says its a webpage loader or something like that
PhoenixByrd, 5.10 has them, just them and it installs the deps as well
Chousuke: like a ubuntu faq guide
install*
kbrooks: yeah, but it's just new stuff.
Chousuke: ???
I cant wait till ubuntu will install and all my mouse buttons work
i upgraded to breezy 2 days ago and everything worked well :)
it's not "We hae accomplished our goals in this distro, and it's polished and cool."

I'm using 5.10, doesn't show up in adept tho. I found the .deb installer tho, just having a pain trying to get all the dependancies

Ep|phany: software problem. youre not locked into amarok and gstreamer. there are tons of ways to play mp3 files. xmms, mp3blaster, alsaplay. alsamixer can adjust your volumes. just try other programs if youre stuck.
i installed sshd, i just don't know how to run it. can annyone lend me a hand.
kvantti, no you should restart the system in single user mode (init 1 as root... you can try sudo init 1 - warning it will close everything)
pppoe_dude, when I restart alsa-utils I get an error saying it cannot open /var/lib/alsa/asound.state for writing, but it does restart it
=== Aurakras [n=Aurakras@chtrmb-163-105.the-beach.net]  has joined #ubuntu

kvantti, then umount / and fsck /dev/hda
ppoe_dude thanks for the basic
boa-chan: there must be a tutorial for that. also look in /usr/share/doc/sshd for help.
pppoe_dude, forget that, I forgot sudo
boa-chan: and maybe there is a sshd-doc package for more documentation
theres nothing under /doc for sshd
these tunes at shoutcast.com digitally imported/ambient chillout really rock..i dont really see why someone has to have that 100 gig mp3 collection..
ubuntu live has no problem with using its acx wireless driver on my system, by the installed ubuntu can't ... lock up/freeze have been addressed by disabling acpi and powernowd and on the ubuntu forums board there seems to be other things that can cause it. I don't find these sort of lockup problems being discussed on distros like knoppix, college linux or even outright debain...
boa-chan: apt-get install sshd-doc     if that package exists

doesnt ubuntu stability depend heavily on the kernel? so i think it's unfair to call ubuntu (or any other distro for that matter) "unstable"
no not really.
I still have lockups, but it seems to takle less time before it happens
depends on how you define stability.
Ep|phany: where do you adjust sound from? inside amarok or from a mixer program? i would suggest using a mixer program, for example alsamixer, or something similar
yeah, a software that is at version 10 is rarely unstable..but gnome is much stable than kde to my experience, and every piece of software is a part of the system..so stability does not depend solely on the system ever

pppoe_dude: of course it does. the stability of a system is the sum of its parts, if any part is unstable that renders the whole system unstable. thus its just to call the system unstable, and fwiw there are other kernels around ;), not to mention more tried versions then 2.6
sophie_, true, however usually you can still render a different distro "unstable" by making a similar configuration... i think it boils down to the ideas in the distro

look thru the ubuntu forums board... compair what you find there with other distro decussion - I wish ubunti was more stable than it apparently is, as there are things I do like about it... but its not helping to promote it (as media stories recently have) as being business ready --- doesn't give a good impression for linux in general...

cast: maybe that is so. Good.
crimsun is that list in the wiki since i do not have any dev contacts?

Delete the profile, I guess.
rm -rf ~/.mozilla

looking for confirmatin of a bug in Hoary: try "vmstat 2 | awk ' {print}' "
vaioubuntu, to do what?
my aim is to use a program called checkinstall to make sourcecode into ubuntu packages
moribus,  d/l from mozilla, tar and link to desktop
vaioubuntu, well install gcc, make, autoconf, whatever else you need
this is the first time ive used linux.  i have no idea of what and where with linux.  can i get gcc, make, etc with the add application program?
mark_: what's that supposed to do?
it should just echo the vmstat output every second
vaioubuntu: there's thousands of packages in the Ubuntu repos, you can probably get 99% of what you want w/o compiling a thing. What apps are you looking for?
mark_: 'vmstat 2' does that
Why would you pipe it into awk?
syntux: should be fine. however, I am fan of using intended software to get tasks done. When I select "remove" for firefox, I don't get all those dependancies. Is somthing else borked? How did you break firefox in the first place??

most important are the widescreen, touchpad, and ive had trouble with the wireless card not playing nice with dhcp
exits even

if I edit grub's 'menu.lst', is there anything else I have to do to make my changes take effect?
I've posted it twice
cafuego: atm, I'm running pan - what else is worth the trouble of installing?
i put a network card in my ubuntu machine how do i check if its connected at 10mbit or 100?
hectorC,  well excuse me for just entering the channel.
I'm using Ubuntu Breezy and after installing kubuntu-desktop I get "Unable to open USB device "usb:/dev/usb/lp0": Permission denied" when I try to print (it was working well before) any help? thanks in advance!

tyson lets do that in private msg so its easy to read stuff
ok, i'll overhaul anyone's transmission who can help me fix dvd playback
Dewi, is it plugged in all the way?
fmasi, np
any linux guru's with a brooken trans?
Dewi, usually it does
cmon
beej_: it's a laptop
Fr0Gs: from the command line, just 'sudo ethtool ethx'
=== auk is now known as _nux
beej_: I have touchpad, I want mouse, so I plug it in... nothing happens
beej_: but if I boot with mouse in, mouse works and no touchpad
sudo: ethtool: command not found
so basically to change pointing device I have to reboot
apart from that, it works
Dewi, that might be a BIOS thing
I'm not sure what I need to trigger
to make it switch
Dewi,  thats odd...
unless it worked with ...other operating systems
I'm having trouble with a startup script.  If my mind serves me correctly.. it looks like it's exiting before the script executes because it can't find the "Source function library" in /etc/init.d/functions or /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions   See: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5589    What is the appropriate directory to point it to for Ubuntu 5.10?  Thanks! :)
try TOTEM-XINE for dvd playback
I've tried restarting hotplug, does nothing
Dewi,  Mine works for both.
beej_: it works with other operating systems
hmm.
i'm assuming you mean microsoft ones?
yeah
so, we know it'
Fr0Gs: it's in the 'ethtool' pkg, would you believe?
we know it's not a bios problem
the problem with linux (vs. windows) for me anyway, is that when I am working on resolving computer issues, i start drinking beer
Dr_willis i downloaded a desklet, how do i install it?
the longer it takes, the more beer i drink
hectorC,  that sounds like a permission issue.. but not sure what sets the permisions for the dev/usb/lp stuff.

chaumurky, I am thinking of doing xubuntu install

fluxbox is, like, forked off blackbox and is found at http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net or the new blackbox, with antialias, better menu, etc.
thanks :)
Could anyone help me with installing a package?

But like can I get rid of gnome, from taking up space? lol
ubotu: got any docs on how to get xfce up and running handy, I wouldnt mind trying it out
I'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about, viscount

well anyways, hi - I tried Ubuntu (first time trying linux) .. sometime ago. I failed. But I learned my lesson -- forcing things like GNOME on a 6 year old laptop - so I'm back, hopefully everything will work out this time. I've a problem though - a lot seems to be gone.. I'm now on shell, and for example, if I "apt" - I get back "bash: apt : command not found"
Now being that I can't do much . . . what would be a good place for me to start
MMond: sudo apt-get
fr500, why does everyone type "MS" "M$?"
i never found it funny, or interesting, or...anything, tbh
beej_: emu10k1 chipset sound card, ESD gives me sound in GNOME apps, alsa / oss do not.
"bash: sudo: command not found"
beej_ M$ - MicrSoft is money
beej_, because of the money :p
yeah, but still
beej_,  I presume because they don't like Microsoft
have any of you PAID for MS software?

beej_, i thought you might be interested :p

is the dvd version of ubuntu worth the download
correct :P
the cd I burned is corrupt aparently
mrkoje: now novell, the largest linux company in the world, tries that crap
how big is the dvd iso
Well download apt....I don't know why it's not on your system already
Put GNOME on it and everything -- hadn't realized the whole perspective, kinda new to Linux, sorry =\
mrkoje: yeah, suse's really not that good, if I ever install a suse*novell distro again i think  i'll go with the novel deskop edition at least its gnome
bshumate,  Well it's retarded either way....
bah, that's what i hate about the linux community, don't get me wrong, i'm all about open source, etc, but companies do need to make money
and of course, they do pretty terribly at it
KeithWeisshar,  its an install an a live cd.. so its handy.
ahh, should md5 check the image 1st
skon: Heh . . . how do I download apt?
NOT to say suse is BAD
then verify the burn
KeithWeisshar,  its an install AND  a live cd.. so its handy.

mrkoje: it is because management are afraid and must get "support" and the "free stuff doesn't come with support"
because that cd has support attached to it

MMond: I think you need to do a fresh install.
KeithWeisshar: dont know, try hitting F3 when you are at the bios stage.. have you set your comp so that the CD will boot?
now I get to reinstall the windows!
:D
what was so great about BeOS anyway
what is the command to uninstall a program?
mrkoje: so-called "server editions" do actually feature support which is not provided in the free versions, such as for high-end server hardware, clustering, failover, HA, etc. etc. that is "too hard" and "resource intensive" to roll by hand...
beos = very very very very fast
very stable
viscount: it did a lot of things quickly and well
viscount,  amazingly fast.. and decent file system.
"Ej25goddess: now I get to reinstall the windows!" why?
but it wasn't a network OS, unfortunately, until right at the end.
plus it had some very cool 'extra' features
bshumate,  ok
mrkoje: plus you must understand, foolish MBAs are driving big business to spend money, and they do not understand tech the way we do.
feugan3333: I tried, I got nasty errors all over . . . from the way things look, I thought it'd be a lot easier to tweak things around a bit . . . ridding of a few things here and there, and then continuing thereof

Using synaptic to remove a program I dont use anymore. What is the difference between a removal and a complete removal ? .. I want to make sure I do not accidently erase anything that is used in other programs
i'll give that a shot
I just removed apache and installed apache2.  when I try to go to localhost via lynx or telnet, connection refused
rosen, complete removal removes the config files as well.
please help me I'm new to linux and I don't know how I can setup a software !
any ideas guys?
rosen, don't worry, it'll never remove anything that another package needs without warning you.
soundray, so it should be ok to use, since I found a better program ? (programs in question is gnomebaker vs. k3b)
rosen, absolutely.
soundray, ah nice :) .. I love buildt in seatbelts

nadira: well, absolutely everything depends on libc so i wouldn't recommend removing it
it still gives that message :s

did you run something as root

no
because iam not even able to compile c programs
you have to close all firefox windows

since you have a strange version of libc6, I do not think you will be able to find a matching version of libc6-dev

Ophiocus, well, ntfsmount in dapper can write to ntfs

writing to existing files, yes. creating new files, no.
=== andrei [n=andrei@86.55.139.190]  has joined #ubuntu

tiglionabbit: i think it's supposed to be a roadmap
is there any other windows manager out there, besides gnome/kde/xfce/fluxbox?
tiglionabbit: let me try it.
mike-e: of course, there are millions
shadox: look like it's xmms-mad
topyli right, but altaught it doesn't seem to work
mike-e: matchbox, icewm, evil, blackbox, uh...   but those are probably the best you listed there
mike-e: oh and can't forget enlightenment
andrei: try http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Compiling_Linux_DCpp
ugh enlightenment
What is the command for showing all processes listed after cpu-usage ? .. I remember getting it but...

Kibou, thanks a lot
tiglionabbit: what's a decent one that's lightweight but pleasent looking?
xfce's taskbar pisses me off
shadox: open up the xmms preferences dialog and see if there's a mp3 plugin
can any body give me the link of backports to add it in the sources.list?
how do i open this preferences dialog?
mike-e: uh, dunno.  Fluxbox is what you make it, though.  But the fluxbox packages in the ubuntu repositories aren't great
I'm happy with gnome.  It feels homey
shadox: personally i'd just get rid of the ugly dog xmms for good, but if you insist...

is there a way to use dpkg to search a package from one of it's files? for example dpkg -option /usr/bin/gcc-4.0 returns gcc-4.0
?
tiglionabbit: yeah my boss made me install kubuntu, the bastard. so I installed gnome and xfce, just trying to see what else is out there
chicano-: whatchoo talkin bout?  You probably can find this info in http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats somewhere
Goshawk_: use apt-file
it's like i'm new to ubunty from yesterday, and some people told me xmms has a mp3 plugin, but like i said is just won't work
mwe, thx
Goshawk_: apt-file search foobar
Goshawk_, dpkg -S will work as well but apt-file let's you search packages that aren't installed too
shadox: try right clicking the xmms window and see if it offers you "options" or "preferences"
k
_jason, mwe thanks
tiglionabbit: did you get the link?
yeah
there is a option part, but is sais things like "play, skip, next, previous" no really "options"

ooh, every time i open this synaptic i receive an warning
what warning is it?
shadox: apt-get install beep-media-player. but i'm pretty sure i listened to mp3s when i was using xmms some 300 years ago
xmms can play mps, and streams from the likes of shoutcast, another point for it
and its gui designers really worked hard to try and make it look cool
Ophiocus: beep-media-player /is/ xmms
isn't it?
shadox, try apt-cache search xmms-libmad or something like that
mwe, $ apt-file search /usr/sbin/mkboot
dunno, like i said, i'm newby =D

is there a way I can restore a specific file from a package? I need to restore the tveeprom kernel module from the 2.6.12-9 kernel
Can anyone remember the correct way to make the shell list all the processes sorted by CPU-Usage ?... or maybe there is another way to do it in Ubuntu ? (like using the GUI)
pasted :)
jono: what do you mean by restore?
QuestionMan : try poking around in here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation
jono: there's a reinstall option in apt, which leaves your configuration alone I believe
tiglionabbit, well, I have inadvertently deleted the module, and I need to get it back - but I don't want to reinstall the entire kernel
oh...
hehe

will mountlo be added on next ubuntu ?
mebaran151: I've tried known good batteries, the bluetooh mouse works ok for a second, then disconnects for what would seem to be no reason

mwe:  should I enable source repositories too?
hehe
cafuego: in theory yes, but in practice I get errors :(
yes I have made the ubuntu install and the devices mount was made during this install. The permissions are rwxr-xr-x and even when I try chmod while I am root, I can't change the permissions to get write permissions on that partition

!tell SealyDav about universe
SuperHero: the source-o-matic is way easiest, I guess
renee_, what I seriously suggest is that you reinstall it - back up anything that might be useful onto CD or loose it - then do things the way we suggest, guess what it works well :)

I just have the server version

is how I install packages

bk: And also read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion. I didn't make ubotu post that for no reason.
mwe: And I've got no mention of any vmware errors in any of the log files, so that's a little distressing.
I really dont see whats so impiorntant about fuirefox 1.5 actually.

how small a swap can i use for 128MB ram.. say 256MB ?
i had a kernel panic wafter updating to breezy :P
[cro] smiley: umount /media/cdrom1
or umount -a
visik7: Is there any way of not formating and still getting it to work?
or umount -l
Razor-X: just a sec
you might need to use sudo for those
rabbit: mmmkay
visik7: to not loose the things i have on it
and how small an install can i do with server install + openbox + totem-xine + codecs
nekostar: If you don't run X, you can even have no swap whatsoever.
when you do an apt-key add where does it put the key?
nothing important though, maybe i should format it anyway

Tedd|: visit packages.ubuntu.com
Tedd|: lftp
Tedd|: you can do ftp with nautilus (connect to server)
Tedd|,    apt-cache search ftp      pick one
Tedd|:  is there something wrong with gFTP ?
whoa!
nalioth: crap. how else can I resize? Knoppix has qtparted?
Tedd|: you're popular :)
I know :P
Necrosan: where did you find that out?
rabbit: It's no FileZilla ;)

double clicking it i assume?
=== cimon [n=cimon@wikipedia/Cimon-avaro]  has left #ubuntu ["Tomorrow]
HurricaneJ: no
anyone else get nothing but trouble with cedega time demo?
what are the ste?ps needed to accomplish the installation
HurricaneJ: rm wifi-radar.gz; sudo apt-get install wifi-radar
Tedd|: try kasablanca
cool
HurricaneJ: in every package you download .. there is a readme.. the .gz is just a fompression format..
HurricaneJ: You don't need to download tarballs.
hd420, it failed on me - then I included for some unknown reason postfix and it worked
Tedd|: ftpcube
benplaut: Thanks, I will
Tedd|: http://filezilla-project.org/nightly.php
it was installed but fails the 3d tests, then ubuntu crashed because of something else. Now cedega will not open at all
sorush20: Trying to make one work
hd420, this box is _not_ a server
It's a joke

has anyone here used   " mail-notification "  ??
There's no chance whatsoever, the fglrx drivers dont even have PCI support in them
Epix: you can try knoppix, i'm not sure if it has qtparted or not
ompaul: so?
Epix: qtparted calls ntfsprogs btw
hey
HurricaneJ: yes.. sudo apt-get install wifi-radar
thats all
And I note there is no fglrx on ppc either.

once its done installing how do i activate it?
cafuego: fglrx on ppc would be a simple recompile for ati. ;)
i wonder if it can be compiled w/WINE, for a half emulation
HurricaneJ: More or less, yes. You can use System -> Administration -> Synaptic for easier management.

=== Epix scrables around for an old knoppix CD
when i install it will it see the other ubuntu install i have and put itself into the copy of grub thats already present or will it overwrite the mbr and make itself the peimary?
hd420, it (1.3.33-8) would not install without postfix with postfix it jumped right in and started ... that is all I can say on it

Inf3ctedFx, make sure an ssh server is running on the remote machine...
I dont know why is not connecting
how do I get JRE working on firefox in ubuntu??
Toma-: ohh yeh i see it now, thanks
how can I know that theine
Inf3ctedFx, is the other machine runnnin Ubuntu as well?
haha
Inf3ctedFx: is the port open on the machine ie not firewalled and is anything listening on port 22?
does anybody would be knowing why i cannot see the 'images' of other people on aMSN 0.95 ?
woodgrain: systemsettings ?
nickrud, what's the std install location for linux applciations: /share or /etc?
B_166-ER-X: are the other people using msn 7.5?
does anyone know of a setting for increasing mouse wheel scroll speed? the mouse preferences do not allow you to change it...
yes mwe
have you guys ever saved a text file in gedit and then opened it with notepad in XP? Can you fix those linefeed chars?
Mr_Molez, use your mouse to go to System --> administration --> disks ... should be able to find it that way!
Inf3ctedFx: I guess the ssh server is not running at the machine
woodgrain, to answer your question from quite a while ago about "make" and compilers, you could also check this out: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html
Toma... i dont know that. but it does that for everyone
woodgrain, standard is: binaries in /usr/bin, libs and the like in /usr/lib/, and the rest usually ends up in /usr/share
ok mwe  maybe now how can I make it run?
=== BearHunter [n=hdskfjhh@60-241-100-105.tpgi.com.au]  has joined #ubuntu
woodgrain, but that's just some random howto i found, try searching around on tldp.org or linuxquestions.com or something for a good guide
B_166-ER-X: ahh i see. join #amsn and ask them
woodgrain: i think its because i just installed a new kernel, it was working before. Ive tried loading all the modules but i still cant get it to work
kameron,  oh, yeah that's where I should have looked to start TLDP!!!! rulez
Inf3ctedFx: so nothing is listening on port 22
woodgrain, i LOVE tldp
thx
How do I change grub to boot to windows by default?
Inf3ctedFx: you need to read a ssh tutorial
Mr_Molez, ask someone else, I can' t help!@
Inf3ctedFx, if the other machine is running Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
woodgrain, dpkg -L <package> tells you where each package puts it's files
woodgrain: hehe ok
oks
anyone, no?
Inf3ctedFx: you can't just expect to be able to ssh to some machine
BearHunter: there is a line called default in menu.lst

=== corptix [i=corptix@d220-237-215-51.dsl.nsw.optusnet.com.au]  has joined #ubuntu

mwe: not an amsn fan? i love it. and the new .95 has webcam support too, very cool.
I'm trying to help a friend with the sound card so I;m going in
yes theine
BearHunter, add a line 'default n' to /boot/grub/menu.lst. Replace n with the number of the stanza that boots Windows. Counting starts at 0.
yeah
Inf3ctedFx, actually your friend needs to install openssh-server of course. did he do that?

Toma-,  I want to cross compile for something else, can ununtu wiki heLP?
Inf3ctedFx, than it's already running on his machine
Inf3ctedFx: you need to install the ssh package

How can I check if my graphic card is properly installed? And if it suports Open GL?
hi!! i'm new, somebody speak spanish?
ryblo_f, try http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto
mwe, it works pretty fine without configuration
Can anyone tell me the command to clear the dmesg list. isnt it something like sudo dmesg -l or something
cant you just pass --march=arm7 or something?
Inf3ctedFx: RTFM. sorry I don't know any better way to explain it
where is the console ? :S:S

ryblo_f, are you using terminal software like minicom?
oks theine
let me c
its ok mwe
theine: ssh works without configuration?
mwe, yes
soundray, that, or just 'sudo echo AT > /dev/ttyS0'
theine: how can I ssh to a machine without a key pair?
can anyone work out why i cant get my cdrom drive working ?
f1k0ym4k4, the 'console' is at alt-ctl-f1
anybody here work alot with gedit & notepad.exe?
I have a problem in linux with kernel memory curroption and need to reboot the kernel, but how can I do this while keeping some programs open and network connections open?

theine: just a password?
mwe, sure
thunderguy: i don't think you can
Thunderguy, I think you ask for the impossible :)\
soundray, no, I understand... but even commands like ATDT do nothing you see

=== JulienH [i=kvirc@jem75-2-82-233-232-223.fbx.proxad.net]  has joined #ubuntu
mwe, no it doesn't
does anyone know of a setting for increasing mouse wheel scroll speed? the mouse preferences do not allow you to change it...
woodgrain: ./configure --target=arm7-linux
i think
It might not be corruption though, what the problem is, /dev/dsp is locked by a program that no longer exists in cpu/memory space.
Is it safe to use the 'saved' option to use the savedefault setting instead of a number?
ryblo_f, how about in minicom? Silence, too?
mwe, that's the standard way of using ssh, private
So how do I unlock a device, that a non-existant program has locked?
soundray, yes minicom, wvdial, even the GTK stuff, silence
zorak: hmm, i know the kde control center has that option, i assumed that gnome does too, but i don't really use gnome
theine: um I would say so, not using encryption keys breaks the basic idea of ssh
Well, what do you know. The kernel I compiled a week ago just decided to start working. :) I installed a new ubuntu kernel in the meantime, so maybe the install procedure for that cast some initrd spells that made it all work.
thunderguy: like a program that's hanging?
mwe, please educate yourself
kameron: Yes, except it isn't hanging anymore, I made it stop hanging and die
adub: no luck so far. I've found myself a serial mouse, will see if I can get that working. Amazing to see how dependent upon a mouse I am!

how do i check what type of image file it is if its readable by gv???

but no option to change accelleration or anything tht will help me.

Hey all. What can I do if epiphany freezes, had to kill it with xkill cze i didnt see anything in ps, I then try to restart it and it wont start.

=== Nogimics [i=n0gimics@server1.smartshells.net]  has left #ubuntu []
rem_: then it probably thinks it's already running and wants to just open another window
adub: I did the 'sudo sh ./ati-driver-installer-8.22.5-i386.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/breezy'
Psi-Jack: but i think he only has COM port ,and it ran nicely under knoppix
rem_: check and check again to make certain it's not running
ok...but why dont i see a process for epiphany ?
then it says that the program will make a directory called 'fglrx-install'
then it proceeds to extraction - which fails horribly T_T
rem_: check if there's a .pid file for it in /var/run
[d-tail]    ok
ps -eaf | grep epiphany
some part of epiphany must still be running
k hold on ..
rem_: ps a | less -- check it manually
skolinux is out
DjDarkman: Wow. I don't even remember what device node is used for serial ports. I'm thinking either /dev/cua1, but I could be wrong.
no .pid file ..

sure
hello toony
adub: they seem to be about scrolling speed, i.e. wheely mouse stuff.
And changing them to 'fast' doesn't make a difference.
good idea why didnt i think of that........lol
anybody running postfix
I'd need xorg-driver-fglrx_8.22.5_1-i386.deb, fglrx-control_8.22.5-1_i386.deb and fglrx-kernel-source_8.22.5-1_i386.deb

This will prevent GNOME from operating correctly. It may be possible to correct the problem by adding  to the file /etc/hosts.

johndd, i think there might be some issues with those, but i dont have nvidia cards on either of my machines, so i dont know from personal experience
bronze, four according to my count :(
Seveas, what is XGL then?
anyone else know how the nvidia drivers are in current dapper?
and it won't let me into the network settings anymore, nor can I use sudo commands in the terminal?!?

can someone ssh me and seeif its ok please
meenfreem: boot in recovery mode and add whatever is in /etc/hostname to the first line of /ets/hosts
bronze, yes
can you  "su -" to root successfully?
but what it wants me to add the " " as in, nothing
just one spacee
meenfreem: pastebin /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts please
meenfreem: ?
If i have separate partitions on the same drive, Can they be mounted in different states? read only/ r+w ?
bronze: better use sudo -i

pastebin is, like, a site where you can post large texts and screenshots so you don't flood the channel. You can find it at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org - Install webboard for easy pasting from the gnome taskbar :)
may i pm someone who is able to help,   question gets lost in the noise
Seveas, can you answer my partition question? ^^^^
meenfreem: just do 'gedit /etc/hostname' and copy and paste to the site ubotu just mentioned, do the same for /etc/hosts
selinium_, the answer is yes
check the demos of xgl with compiz -- very very sweet

you're very welcome :D
meenfreem: we'll fix it don't worry, we just need to see what those files look like so we can telll you what to do
bubbleentity{L}, your best bet is to repeat and possibly rephrase your question. Winmodems are an annoying subject though.
johndd, which nvidia card do you have?

soundray, linmodem works under other distro

Seveas, Wow! xgl,is it going to be in dapper?
Im lookin for pages about learning about ubuntu, got any good ones?
meenfreem: well, thats a problem :-)

anyone know if seveas' repository is down or issues with the GPG keys?

anybody know any good sites about learning ubuntu?
I didn't know *HOW* I did it, fact is, it works!
_jason, the gedit is read only?
[D-Tail] , cool
getting timeouts getting hid key
after I edited my xorg.conf, X crashed.
port7, which mirror are you trying?
s/hid/his
bubbleentity{L}, are you following any instructions, and can I see them?
Seveas, that string you suggested fails as well
some syntactical error, I figured... I NANO'd it, fixed it and by that time my whole linux locked up on me
meenfreem: you need to reboot and choose 'recovery mode' from the grub menu.  That will give you root access.  Then use 'nano' instead of gedit

gnomefreak: .c means C. you probably want to name your files .cpp or something

i cant get as far as modprobe because it wont initiate installation
but it all worked fine under the other kernel b4 update
Deepz, I suggest you do this: 'sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils' (expect this to say "already the newest...". Then just enter 'sudo modprobe ndiswrapper' and see if the interface appears. If not, reinstall your driver.

mlistus, read package description 'apt-cache show dfsbuild'
mod^: how about iptables -L
i get this /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko
its in the old kernel folder
target     prot opt source               destination
so no rules.....
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination
nothing
also /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/misc/ndiswrapper.ko
should I try to reinstall postfix
i would be glad if someone would help me with this problem: music (mp3, ogg etc) playback crackles (only) while copying files from cd to harddisk. could you imagine why? i'm using ubuntu breezy on dell inspiron 5150c.

thanks for your time

mod^: but you can telnet to port 25 by telneting to your domain? and does it give you postfix?

zulfiqar, what if you unmount and remount it. Same problem on df -h?
mod^: okay try reinstalling postfix using aptitutde.
so ndisdwrapper should work by itself without any need for recompilation right?
I'm trying to defrag the drive on windows and then once done i will check again
Deepz, yes.
ok tnx
mod^: remove it, do apt-get update, and run aptitude again to reinstall postfix.

same result

Why isn't Mozilla Firefox v1.5x in the Ubuntu repository?
Cryptid: you can try opening /etc/X11/xorg.conf using your favourite text editor (via sudo), searching for "nvidia" and replacing it with "nv". Then run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
zebraFusion: it means there's a bug in the driver which prevents you from using a certain video output mode
mm - can ext3 filesystem become fragmentated too??
fangorious, ok
RememberPOL: it is in Dapper. It was released after Breezy, so that's why it's not in there.
=== exxylan [n=exxylan@p54A29191.dip0.t-ipconnect.de]  has joined #ubuntu
maihem: Yes but why not allow current Breezy users be able to upgrade to it?
fangorious, but it says to do something and I have no idea what
so we want to start "gstreamer-properties" and tell it not to use xv for video. (This is the same as starting "Multimedia Systems Selector", a Preferences application that is currently hidden in your menu system)
RememberPOL:  because breezy was frozen before 1.5 was released
zebraFusion: on the menubar at the top of your screen you'll see "System", which has a "Preferences" sub-menu, which in turn has a "Multimedia Systems Selector" item which lets you specify the video output mode
what does that mean

RememberPOL: because whole new versions cmoe out once every siz months, so on average you only have to wait for three.
I thought new Ubuntu versions were to feature complete new software packages and system features not just upgraded versions of the same package that could just as well be available using the Update Manager?
fangorious, if you read the paragraph it says it's currently hidden in your menu system.
Cryptid: ah, gedit is not going to work in this case. try sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
maihem: But okay thank you. I will follow the wiki:FirefoxNewVersion instructions.
zebraFusion: the program started by that menu item is 'gstreamer-properties', which you can also start by typing that into a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal)

Teecee_Home, ever used any of those in your ubuntu machine?
FlannelKing: which will be grub >?
Teecee_Home: phreak97 seems to know what's going on more than me. :-/
I did in the terminal gconf, that that did not bring up gconf, how do I get into gconf?
it is broken on every installation I did on every client we got here
Teecee_Home: no, bash.  Wait for it to go "input not supported" then switch to a terminal.
Teecee_Home: but i suggest booting into recovery mopde and reconfigging xorg
ok there
this is going to sound pretty dumb, but does anybody know where I can find a manual for 'vigr'? I have no clue how to use it
FlannelKing: I am there now
phreak97,  I found this thread (about Suse actually) that may shed some light on Teecee_Home 's prob  http://www.linuxcompatible.org/thread27341-1.html
=== r0bby2 is now known as r0bby
Teecee_Home: now you just have to log in, then change your resolution.  I don't know how, but, that's the easy part.  There are tutorials and stuff.
=== Aegir [n=richard@d58-105-60-165.dsl.vic.optusnet.com.au]  has joined #ubuntu
Curtman: well if you are positive it isn't getting mounted elsewhere ('mount' command) I don't know what else to check
FlannelKing: thanks boss, I appreciate it
_jason, Damn..  Neither do I.  That's why I came here.  :(
warpzone: 'man vigr'?

how does one access gconf?
navarone, similar issue, but not exactly the same
Curtman: don't worry there are a lot of smarter people than me around, just ask again in a bit
_jason: interesting read.  good to know we're a hard target
_jason: lol, I meant like, how to edit lines in vigr? man doesnt do much for it
Teecee_Home, are you using a lcd screen? They say lcd's require lower refresh rates than crt's...maybe you need to lower refresh rate
warpzone: what editor are you using?
doesn anyone know how to change the gnome desktop resolution and monitor refresh via console?
Curtman: an existing line in /etc/fstab getting in the way? (guessing)
navarone: yes I am
got it, it is gconf-editor
_jason: trying to edit the groups using vigr
!fixres
Please read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
phreak97, Teecee_Home : see above
already there, ty guys
bimberi: in fstab, I have: "/dev/hdb1       /media/tunes    ext3    defaults        0       2", like it should be.  It used to mount fine.
when i type make after ./configuring a program it tells me no targets are specified and no make file found.
warpzone: readlink -f $(which editor)

warpzone: ? that just tells you the editor (I think)
jimcooncat, the progress bar on my brown ubuntu startup screen does nothing
Curtman: does 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdb' list the partition?
when first booting, or after login?
while booting
this is weird...opening a link via right-click open in new tab in xchat opens the link in a new window w/ ff1.5
hey guys
anyone know what lmysqlclient is?
i think i need it
I know this is the ubuntu channel but mabye someone can help me
bimberi: Yep.. It says "/dev/hdb1               1      155127    78183976+  83  Linux"
warpzone: my guess is you are using vi
GeorgeAScott: what are you attempting to insatll?
dunno phreak97, but you can turn it off in grub and see just text
jimcooncat, how so?
brenner:  check  settings -> advanced -> url handlers   in xchat
banshee 0.10.6
i'm running kubuntu 5.10 with KDE 3.5.1 and I just installed my ubuntu ati drivers, now when I boot up and log in it freezes as soon as it loads, any ideas?
bimberi: And 'lsof /dev/hdb1', and 'lsof /media/tunes' return nothing at all.
how do i get into grub settings?
wastrel: what should i be looking for?
_jason oooo gotcha, thought vigr was different from vi

Can I get some ATI help? (Dapper) No one is helping on #ubuntu+1...
bimberi: Nothing.  There's no way that's the problem if it does it in single user mode.
can you guys check out a web application for me and tell me what you think
brenner: well no i just used an online modeline generator.  i am shooting in the dark when it comes to x
warpzone: apparently it just goes straight to vi if you don't have EDITOR set, you can do something like 'EDITOR=nano sudo vigr' to use nano.  Or just learn vi, it's great :)

is there a way to access files on my ntfs hdd?
i downloaded the iso ... i put in the cd, it gave me the option to press enter or type server, so i pressed enter then:
alarmyst, have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Webcam
when i double click the hdd on my desktop it says..
matthew_w, like you have to learn how to package for ubuntu, or for red hat, or for windows -- different techniques for each
invalid compressed format (err=1). 2nd line ( last line). Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0)
that i don't have permission
which package is kdialog in?
robr; hrm...
mikebot, right-click on the drive, hit Properties - who is listed as owner?
mikebot: you can read them, but I wouldn't advise writing to it
I need a version of the instructions at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575 with explanations
alarmyst google for spca5xx and look at the table of cameras they support... that's just one driver, other drivers will support other cams

matthew_w: its an asus mobo, asus cd-r, amd cpu i think ...
mikebot, yes, you can copy stuff off NTFS drives
robr; I mean, is there anything special about how you have your hard drives set up
Madpilot: I'm having trouble with that...

dave: what res. do you want
Madpilot: (dapper)
robr; like, a few masters and slaves etc?

Madhow do i do that when it says i don't have permission to opent he folder?
Madpilot: no one is being helpful there

i tryed it in breezy

bubba_: no, not that i'm aware of, i'm pretty sure it is enabled, unless i need to set somewhere acpi=on or whatnot
or I mean a .run file
ah I gotta d/l right platform binary still damn it :p
nitrox: if you're running putty, it's native windows.
and it just does nothing
eob84: what does it do?
graft, it's kded
eob84: ./script-name?
it says this

Crshman, I dont know what you specificly have to do. I didnt, I had to specificly disable acpi, then re-enable it after I figured out how to fix my problem.
eob84: or sh ./ut-install-428.run
bubba_: ahh ok, i'll try it, thnx
biovore, I did that
hello all
nitrox: using what?  X tunneling? or what?  That'll be cygwin with the program "xwin", if youre doing it locally (on a LAN) you can use XDCMP (or acronym like that) straight in cygwin, but if it's outside of a LAN, you'll have problems (and have to use putty and other methods) becaues xwin uses UDP

whats the default runlevel
?
Datatec: could you put the output on pastebin? need to see it
sphex: that would work too
gnomefreak, jobezone guys removed the dots
kingspawn: it will take some time to type, but I will do it
eneried: then you edit a file, type #!/bin/bash at the first line, then your commands, and save it.
gnomefreak, jobezone install from cd or update ?
BockBilbo: apt-get -d install <package>
gleesond: what do you mean default run level?
Datatec: you can copy it with your mouse
thanks bimberi
update
Datatec: just hilight it, right click, and hit copy
is it 3
_jim_: update first
polpak, hmm ... ok....

i guess it will work for

I am trying to use SVN and the funny thing is the system don't recognize the svn command, any suggestions?

gleesond: there is no "default" run level type runlevel to know what your using
thanks, kingspawn
in /etc there is a bunch of rc[1-6] .d

thank you so much
sskroeder, the exploit that was used in this previous incedent..  How old was the vulnerablity at that time?
Datatec: ah, of course, i forgot :/
ive got this weird problem and now at bootup and shutdown i just get a black screen
i have another question
_jim_: yes, run 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
gleesond: there is no such thing as a default run level it will use any from 2-6 iirc they are all multi person
jobezone, upgrade or install ?
sskroeder, the reason I ask is properly configuring a chrooted environment, particuarly one with access to many outside services (mail, databases, etc), can be very difficult unless you're experienced with the process
_jim_: or do it graphically, of course
_jim_: upgrade
_jim_: the graphical window you got does the same...
jmg: that box WILL BE slow no matter what. :p~
Talldave2002: do you have another copy about that was installed using another method? otherwise try 'sudo apt-get remove --purge wine'
gnomefreak: for debian and derived distros the default runlevel is 2
polpak, i don't know -- i haven't been fully briefed yet - i started on the job just 2 weeks ago ...
i need to place an alias to a folder, imagin teh folder was /windows/disk1/folder and i need to make it works like /folder
jobezone, ill do from terminal :-)
_jim_: but maybe it's best to do it in the terminal, to see for errors
but redcrap and some others use runlevel 5
jmp_me: its used 4 here without me changing anything
=(
eneried: sudo ln -s /windows/disk1/folder /folder
o that gonna take a little time
gnomefreak: solaris is 3 and I thought that linux used a different numbering skeem
iirc runlevel 6 is shutdown
sphex: might be better to use ext3 or even ext2
6 is reboot iirc
thanks, bimberi
bimberi seemi i have but cant find it
0 is shutdown
gleesond: your safe with 2
polpak, but i know that the servers hadn't been patched for quite a while (they were still using some  old version of apache - 1.3.27 i think)
maybe i got that backwards
Talldave2002: 'which wine'
sphex: it could be the difference between slow and really fracking slow
jmg: im fairly sure 6 is shutdown but now you got me thinking lol
i am getting the following error when trying to unmount my ipod "eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument" anyone got any ideas
gnomefreak: I need to edit the rc*.d so my /etc/resolv.conf doesn't get overwritten every time I reboot
jmg: ok
gnomefreak, jobezone it will take me about 20 - 30 minutes
bimberi, and you know if that solution was persistent? i mean when i reboot the machine the alias remains?
gnomefreak, jobezone it will install automatically ?

what's the sudo command to give amule (or any program) permission to write to a particular directory?
d3wd, yes, the install process is pretty straight forward
or
Hmmm
d3wd, are you planning to dual boot, or just go whole hog?
good question
polpak, still - i need to have an overview over the advantages of having the chroot-jail in effect... and compare them to the added effort to keep things up-to-date ..
d3wd: installation has gotten much easier in any case - I say burn you own iso and go for it :-)
polpak: That's what I thought.
polpak: whole hog
there was 2 partitions in hdb, so doesn't that make sense?
I already repartitioned the hard drive
Talldave2002: yes a wine installed by a .deb is /usr/bin/wine (iirc) so it will be superceded by /usr/local/bin/wine

The best way for you to make amule write into some directory, is to change the permisions of that directory, so that you, and amule, can write into it. That, or you can run amule as root (using 'sudo amule') but that is not a good thing, don't do it!

coir, all right.  which computer is serving the files?
+R
odin: hmm, worked fine for me.. let me check online
eobanb_, I'd like both to be visible to one another - that is an option, aye?
NickGarvey: or on this other page, it just gives me a grey box where the vid is suppose to be
FearMoth: snd-intel8x0 is dmixed by default, so it supports multiple applications' sounds -- unless one of those is an oss-only app, like Flash or Skype
coir, i guess so, but the way file sharing works is one computer acts as the server, and the other acts as the client.

eobanb_: nope
djs_2_6, i think most people here just use metacity.
jmg: Ah I see.. thanks for that advice..
i just installed Ubuntu, installed the ATI Driver for my  video card, X say it's running at 1200x800 (my native screen resolution) but applications looks too big
icons too
thanks _jim_
jmg, he was trying to share files between a mac os x and an ubuntu computer
blind, no problem
jmg i was loging in as the profile i set up during the install and i dont know what sudo is
it doesnt seem as it were 1200x800
eobanb_ - Really?  Nothing better, or what?
(anna)O: how did you install?
djs_2_6, well metacity is the default in gnome, and most people on ubuntu use gnome, so i would think that's what almost everyone uses.  whether there is something 'better' out there is pretty subjective
jmg off the bootable cd
Chris_Tucker: sed -e 's/\n/ /g' file.txt > file.new.txt
djs_2_6, if you're unhappy with gnome i can recommend alternatives, though.
any idea

I tried enlightenment, but found that I needed more of a desktop environment than that...
its pretty though

I know, I am running ubuntu, but trying to help a friend with cygwin
Fensta: best way to do it if your bios lets you select which device to boot from. I have one IDE and one SATA and I can F9 and pick either to boot install XP or Ubuntu.

why cant i join another server?

i want to join the java room...

jmg its zero
he needs to connect to our school's computer so that he can do some homework
benoy: those are 2 different things my friend :-)
I tried booting the live cd, and it's doing the same thing the install cd did. says "no NTFS volumes found, exiting". And then it just goes to dr-dos, rather than doing anything like run ubuntu

Xenguy, i was hoping to use the inbuilt --compare option to tar, but tar seems to ignore files that are not in the archive and doesnt seem to give an option to tell me that
when i type in "ssh -X username@serveraddress.edu" It asks for the password, which i enter correctly.  Then I get access to the school's server.  When I type in matlab, it gives me a textbased environment rather than a gui window but if I do the same steps on my ubuntu computer, I get a graphical interface which is what I need because I need to deal with graphs and other visual aids.

i have it on my debian sarge as an applet on kde
is opengl installed by default?

mandrake, suse, and 3 versions of ubuntu
I'm just afraid I'll upgrade and my whole system will die
:O
roy: because the kernel is in panic.
Cody`: what ornage are you talking about exactly?  I change to clearlooks and can't find anything right away
yeah but why?
if I change to clearlooks
how do i fix that?
roy: Kernel panic is Linux's version of the bluescreen of death
the title bar is still this fugly orange

because
ok installation is complete, but why is everything caps in my console?

why doesnt ubuntu tell me the problem is it cant handle fat32, dont other distros handle fat32 ?
put it this way ford parts don't work on a chevy same thing with windows/linux
pip` you are misunderstanding, linux can read FAT32, it can't install to it
so ubuntu isnt good at giving error messages ?

this is second kerenl i tried compiling and i can't figure it out

 Is there any good video editing software available for Ubuntu?

BlueSwirl, I found kino.
so its builtin
is it possible to play windows games on linux?
QMario: there are not any high quality ones as of yet
Are there any others?
hey guys, i already have kubuntu on cd, how does that compare to ubuntu or easyubuntu ?
QMario: have you tried kino?
pip`: kubuntu's the best :P
pip`: it has kde instead of gnome.
=== spikeb shrugs
wre see www.winehq.org
pip`: it's worth trying out both gnome and kde, and seeing which you prefer. :)
Yes, but it is unable to open my .avi media files.
HIGH-FREQ: do you have ide (or whatever kind of drive you have) support built into the kernel as well ?
ohh ok
QMario: ah boo. er, i'm stuck then :(
is it possible from the prevous windows viruses?
LinuxJones: i've checked every single thing...lemme recheck...i followed the howtoes and all that..but i'm gnona double check "everything"
wre, what do you mean?
i had viruses on window prevously before switching
wre, they're not there anymore
the man page for wget (specifically options -A and -R) refers to ``@pxref{Types of Files}''  What does that mean?  Where can I find that?
wre there were some attempts to run windows viruses on wine but they went poorly :)
I can't find openssl-dev from apt-cache search. why?
QMario: cinellera is a more capable video editor, but you won't find it in the ubuntu repositories.
wre, assuming you installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu and erased the entire windows partition
i can't even get into my DESKTOp
wre in windows, right?
HIGH-FREQ: the ubuntu kernels use an initrd so most of the things like ide support are built as modules.

nope

Ng, for amd64
i have windows and linux on same hard drive

ok
ok, that will make pages load faster
i just want it to _launch_ faster
as for your other problem, for example, you need to configure your IRC client to use firefox
it did launch faster that time, but im guessing its from cache
that wont affect launch
only page loading time

Just wanted some advice and recommendations. I have a remote client that has a coal mine out in the sticks. They have an ISDN line for internet connectivity. They are currently using a windows box running kerio mail server and kerio firewall. The solution is not working as they are getting very large phone bills and the mail is unreliable. i am going
out there tomorrow and I want to put down a Linux box. I have a customised build that I want to set-up there. I normally use this for Small ADSL clients but have never set-up a solution to control ISDN dial-ups and restrict call charges. It would be an added bonus if I could control users dialing up by forcing them to use some type ofauthentication proxy. any ideas?

argh, so annoying that when you connect through places to a server that is down that it locks up almost everything till it times out.

Question: My /etc/hostname on a Ubuntu server keeps resetting (on any reboot) to have contents of "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain" So then anything that is based on /etc/hostname (like prompts, login, uname, etc.) keep coming out as 127 or 127.0.0.1 instead of the machine's name.  Doesn't seem to affect anything it is running, but a bit disconcerting. Manually doing 'sudo hostname machinename' fixes until next reboot. :-( Suggestions?

as cef said, either you DON'T have a dvd player but a cdrom in which case you put the wrong media into the wrong device
stasislove: any particular reason you're not installing wine from the repositories?
or libdvdcss cannot decode the encoding for the dvd
one or the other
libdvdcss has nothing to do with hardware
stasislove: flex should be in the repositories too though
so then it was this specific dvd?
is there any necessary for me to delete the old archives in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
ydnar, in which case just do what i told you and run vlc from command line and quit talking already :)
oh

my problems are a) nvidia card. my screen resolution is 640x480 and I can-t click trough the installation because the rest of the installation dialog is outside my screen
AnAnt: http://packages.ubuntu.com/ can search packages for specific files
ubuntuNewbee: just ask, if someone can help you, they will
holycow: well. its hard to explain
Ng, yes i'm well aware of that and i'm done some reading and i'm quite content with what i've found and i dont use my mouse i use keyboard shifting unless i want to slide applications over.  its nifty on my 21" CRt
the_Kane, free for ram, top for processes, uname -a for cpu
!find libtermcap.so

!tell __doc__ about fixres
AnAnt: Install apt-file, do apt-file update and apt-file search libtermcap.so.2
are there problems with the Switch user?

On the website https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue1 you can read that there are updates for epihany-browser and other packages (section Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Updates). But they are not available on the mirrors (at least not in binary form). The source packages do exist.

you can remove it from fstab and manually mount it
ok

Toma-, yeah, they worked just before the dist-upgrade infact with last weeks beta.  the weird thing is this  upgrade seems to have updated the kernel, i had to fix nvidia manually and its probably interfering with sound now too
speakers on and plugged in ?  right click volume control and go to the sound level adjustments and or mute panel ?

ubuntuforums.org is awesome.  it gets so much traffic my posts get outdated pretty quick with the new dapper release.  no one replies !
but to some quetions they wont be ignored
protocol1, well i managed to make the speakers squeal by checking the wrong input box while i had another cardin to test ... i'll try th eother port again, but this one looks green to me ...
holycow: im guessing you might have had a modified /etc/modules/aliases file, and the dist-upgrade hasnt installed all the new aliases.
mine was a query for best gnome apps that are unknown
i find that the forums arnt good for really technical stuff
when i press i in vi , kinda nothing happens , how to move pointer around
holycow: but thats just my first guess :( hope it points you somewhere! and sorry! :)
like in normal text editor?

Ng: As it seems that nobody answers, it remains to me to present here the problem. I created the power user (sudoer), then a normal user. From my first account I switched (with the switch user button) to the normal account. From the normal account I chose log off and there was the problem: The greeter failed to show 6 times. After 6 times a message shows in text mode (very wired characters),...
...that tells me that "The display server has been shut down about 6 times in the last 90 seconds. I is likely that something bad is going on. Waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display :0". After 2 minutes nothing happens.

any idea?
is it possible to make totem play a video slower than its normal rate (slow motion)?
Adrian_NZ, yeah, i was just wondering if there was any [software]  prep needed with ubuntu that i may not know about

tritium: i agree not everyone dual boots, but i guess almost everyone does this. isn't it a strange decision for the dapper team not to use a splash menu, especially seeing that breezy used to feature that? i mean, do you at least agree it's quite strange and maybe improper?

<moonman> wahoo!!!, anyway, bung it in, then you may want to install the ati drivers, although i've never had an ati card myself so i can't be much more help than that.
I'll try that.  One problem is, it doesn't detect the location and I'm not sure how to tell it in this computer.  It's an ISA card.
chennaituxian: the thing i miss the most is multitasking personally, CLI forces you to focus
farous: ATI 9200, and ATI9200se... it works... but only for one card at a time... I can't get three heads running, as X crashes.
makko: if it's not hidden for dual-booters, where is the problem?
Faileas: open up multiple terminals :D
Adrian_NZ, i got the card via newegg, so i could play this one game, www.ufoai.net should take you to the site for the game

Corey: move or copy ?
guys i find this funny. initially i installed ubuntu then installed KDE & XFCE. now, after grub the icon says kubuntu... then during the login session it's Xubuntu... how can i make ubuntu as a default?
tritium: Compaq Presaio 2200
uh
copy
or move
move..
just move how do i do that
Corey: cp /source /destintion
tritium: anyway, i hope you understand that i wasn't trying to persuade you to fight for my cause, but just to try to talk in such a way as to show me you didn't think my point was stupid. i didn't get anything like that from you, but, hey, that's it.

Yeah its normal for me
you don't get random cutouts on packages then
Okay ina  few min ill be wiping this drive for breezy badger (getting dapper in mail soon)
It would say error
or cut off
Ar2No, that means you don't have access to proftp, most likely. replace /etc/apt/sources.list with the contents of http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 if you are using dapper.
(will wipe again soon)
echo -e "EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim; export EDITOR" >> /etc/profile
you're so good
is there an easy way to reinstall dapper over my current OS?
is that just because of the high strain on the servers?
Deedubb: you want to change the system-wide default editor?
I did
Try this (1) apt-get update (2)apt-get upgrade (3)apt-get auto clean and reset your modem
yes
when the time comes that I'm ready to dedicate a larger part of the hard drive to Ubuntu, would I be better off just blowing away the present partitions and starting over with a new install?
dr3wster: wipe off your OS and make a fresh install :D
Deedubb: you may want to use "update-alternatives --config editor"
Deedubb: "sudo update-alternative s--config editor"

I got a problem! - The horizontal scrolling feat. from synaptics driver does exactly the opposite when I use firefox.
I'm on AMD64 Dapper, but I can't get the nvidia drivers to load properly
What do I need to do to fix that?
dr3wster: gnome-settings-daemon is part of the gnome-control-center try reinstalling it
with the other applications, the synaptics driver works fine.
otherwise you will have to reinstall or continue debugging no one know how long either might take
farous, maybe this other error message will help.  I get it when trying to open the theme preferences window: Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect. This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager.
william__, oh. it sounds really good, but i worked long and hard to install all the restricted formats (kicking myself now that i read about this program) and i'm kinda scared it will mess something up. but i remember it for a time when i feel more daring.
i'm getting the infamous grub error 18 on boot, is their anything I need to do other than make a small /boot partition?

kman, u need unpartitioned space, on your harddrive
Kman: is that space used by another partition, like geotsai says?
i have space on my windows partition, about 28 GB
kman, go into manually edit the partition table, its so much easier
but i dont wanna fuck up my laptop
use a virtual machine
axion for firefox?
Kman: then it's not free space, it's already used in a windows partition
are you on the live cd right now?

use partition magic
go into manually edit the partition table, you can resize the windows partition

hi! I've enabled beagle in dapper and it works well but when i search for some things that i have in one folder, using nautilus or the menu options, it doesn't find them. It finds the folder where they are,but no more. I thought that this could be because of indexing (this folder is in /home/me/.../folder so it should have been indexed
i have nothing important
xtraitorx: they are listed here http://banshee-project.org/Banshee_Source
anyone knows how to tell beagle to index things?
i just dont wanna have to deal with reinstalling windows

tragek: the standard install CD for ubuntu is a live CD, just try, ACPI should work
you need the newer version from the intel-web-page
ok
anyone know of a good multi picture renamer?
dig
@voraistor: why acpi should work?
mmk. I have a couple old hoary shipits sitting around; can just apt-get dist-upgrade straight to dapper, or am I gonna run into a crap load of dependency issues?
if the dsdt-table under acpi is broken, you will have to fix it
armenb: (from "How Linux Works") PC hardware has a battery-backed "real time" clock. It's not the greatest clock in the world, but it's better than nothing. The kernel usually sets its time based on this clock at boot time, and you can reset the system clock to the current hardware time with the command 'hwclock'.
tragek: nope, but fresh install is better i think
tragek: you're supposed to go one step at a time:  hoary -> breezy -> dapper

hello all, what would you recommend to test how well my binary nvidia drivers are working. Normally I'd use glxgears, but ubuntus version doesn't seem to output stats

Hello. When I connect to a server via SSH with "-R 1324:TARGET_IP:80" it only listens to 127.0.0.1:1234. How can I make the remote machine listen to 0.0.0.0:1234?
Or maybe I can manage it without ssh and just use iptables. So how can I redirect connections from "-i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 1234" to TARGET_IP:80 (and its answers back to the client)?
is the first user (durin the installation) created the root ?
or is "su" the way to get to the root
efox, no, root passwd is disabled in ubuntu by default
efox, just use sudo in front of your commands
i am logged in as the first user created, is that a smart thing to do ?
ubotu, tell efox about sudo
efox: no. the first ordinary user created (uid 1000) is the one allowed to sudo to root, by virtue of belonging to the right groups

no no..i kno bout sudo and su...im jus readin off a site (not that credible) about some linux stuff and it said that the first user created has all rights like root and shouldnt be used cuz u can damage your system

Adium: No, I understand the answer to this problem. I want a general undertstanding. My biggest problem with linux right now is dependencies and trying to use apt-get, and it's really becoming a deal killer
looks like you want "libgtk1.2" - the number is almost always part of the package name
earHertz, if you've got a GUI, use Synaptic - it's far easier than farting around with apt-get trying to guess package names
Yeah, but if I try to apt-get libgtk-1.2, it tell sme no package. Is my apt-get misconfigured?

I hate the volume control in gnome. For me, when I'm listening in Rhytmbox, when it's at 100% the sound just sounds bad, lacks midrange and treble and when it's at 0% there is still sound, just a little lower and the quality is better. Why is that?

johlin: set main sound for GNOME to 80%, and regulate then RM volume as you want
80% of PCM volume is most optimal volume, also in Windows
RB volume is mostly for just making things a relatively louder or vice versa
Pitersburgs: Yeah I know, but it's annoying when I have other applications open with sound (movie player for example)
I want it to control the main volume, as it's supposed to
nop
main volume is main volume
each of apps has it's own volume

hi
so you can mix sources
So what does the gnome volume control do?
johlin: regulates main volume and other volumes of sound card
RB volume regulator regulates *RB* volume, not main
so
you for example
when you get call from Skype
you can tune down RB
but system volume will stay the same
But when I press the volume buttons on my keyboard, that should be the main volume right?

johlin: yes
Pitersburgs: but it doesn't, when it's at 0% I can still hear rhytmbox clearly (even though the sound quality sucks)
johlin: wait a sec...you use your laptop/desktop keyboard keys to tune main volume up/down.
first of all, check it is it really main volume
johlin: as far as I can tell, it's a bug...
heh..great!..xmms is quite close as functionality to winamp
finaly something familiar:D
uhh but xmms is shocking! The dialogs.. ugh
dragos: but amarok is much nicer
I have amarok, but I can't play .mp3 files
it is still a bloody media player, what there is so nicer/uglier
:)
dragos: read the pms you got
Pitersburgs: How do I check? Those buttons are selected as volume up/down in gnome keyboard shortcut settings, is that all?
okey
!restricted > dragos
Frogzoo: so should I report it somewhere?
google's summer of code is working on an xmms2... maybe that'll be the ticket
johlin: I think the devs know already ;)
johlin: take a look upper corner right, where is that sound volume applet
dragos you'll need to get those restricted formats installed to use them in amarok
click a right button on it

I would like to have a remote printer shared via cups discovery set as default printer.  Trying to configure it via the web interface redirects me from the remote IP (non-SSL) to the hostname (SSL).  The latter page is never loaded and times out eventually.
How can I set the remote printer as default.  What is wrong in the configs?
uep: xmms2 almost is the same as bmp, which is already aviable
Pitersburgs: there's the user interface, sound quality ...
Pitersburgs: yes, main volume was selected, and my soundcard (SB Live, ALSA) was selected.
ok check this weird problem, when I have no audio programs open, and I crank my sound to the max, my its making a bass sound
Pitersburgs: I think you are not correct.  The code base is totally different, the concept is too.

well how come it let me do it when updating etc
wasnt that root?
reiki, readding the printer wouldn't help

RQ: well sudo -i will reset the environment variables, so it's usually preferred.  sudo -i is like su - and sudo -s seems to be like just su
atlantian - read the link above. sudo enables u to exec a command as root

sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.

starscream[2] : sounds like it... no linux partitions found...
Silenti-Ambulo: there should be a switch on the front for WLAN... this one caught me out once, and I thought my wireless was broken
Jack_sparrow, I will reinstall ubuntu and put grub in the right place this time
starscream[2] : reinstall Ub
npster, sudo aptitude install build-essentials
cool
linuxd00d: wrong channel :p
and then you'll got g++
Jack_Sparrow, fingers crossed eh?
hrmm Automatiix is amazing
DarkAudit, the switch doesn't light up anymore.... and it's onboard.....
woulda saved me alot of time

Hit3k, alternatively use a program called Automatix (search ubuntu forums for it), it will auto install java amongst other things you can choose from)
Silenti-Ambulo: OK. What you can do no is to install another kernel, like the i386 kernel if you're working with the pentium optimized. Or you take an older version. By installing that, you will have the choice on the next boot <esc> to choose the kernel. Choose the new instakked one and try to configure your card.

nicholaspaul: if you HAVE to replace the old drive...here's what you SHOULD do...repartition that drive with a partition the EXACT same size as your old HD's partition and the rest just unpartitioned.  then 'dd bs=1M if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/hdd1' ... then 'dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdd' ... then shut down and switch out the drives....then reboot
nicholaspaul: that WILL work...then you'll need to parted to resize the paritition

I think SuSE is even better for everyday use, but because stuff is in odd places, it's less easily customizable.

Hey all. Is it possible to add a link to a folder to the Places menu?
you write via your filesystem driver
but write support for ntfs is pretty new
Paladine: is there no safe way to write ntfs from linux... if not ext2/ 3 maybe reiserfs
so that external HD I'm thinking of getting would be best off formatted in FAT32 if it's going to be used by XP and Linux boxes?

DarkAudit: Or ext2. Ext2 can be safely written from Windows.
slaxy, it is totallyunsafe to write to NTFS unless the system is live irrespective of where you are trying to do it from, unless you are accessing it as a samba share
the ntfs filesystem needs to be live
yeah get the ext driver for win pretty safe way round
what do u mean by live ????
itisbecause of the way ntfs works
or better still get vmware and run windows under linux
it needs to be on a booted system (as in windows)

accessed via samba

=== tanath [n=user@d36-72-255.home1.cgocable.net]  has joined #ubuntu
DarkAudit: Well, here's the deal.  FAT32 would be more portable, cause every OS can read/write without drivers. You can take it anywhere, to any computer, no need to install anything.  The prob is that FAT32 has a maximum file size.  ext2 can be read/write in Windows, but it requires custom drivers. You can install them on any windows install. And it doesn't have a stupid max file size.

Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments. The default install includes a server kernel and no GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current stable version is 6.06 LTS. For more info see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerFaq/
Im not sure I understand paladine as I understand it ntfs write underlinux doesnt support all ACL attributes buth thats a long way from it will definately destroy your partition?
slaxy, you can instruct vmware to create a guest OS from an existing windows installation
wweasel: yes. on that window, there are two tabs at the top. click on "Custom application launcher"
Done
Paladine, then it sounds to me like you don't know much of what you're talking about, frankly

pushpop: You could try adding the drive as "native" (I think you need vmware server for that). BUT! Beware, it says it's risky!
pushpop. why not just install ubuntu on the other partition and dual boot after that?

Hey everyone, I'm having troubles with my iMac G3. I am trying to install dapper, and after I do the known change to xorg.conf*changing the horiszontal and vertical settings* and try to restart gdm...it fails. Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong? That and for some reason my computer screen is cutting off 2 characters off of the left side.
I want to set up a bridge between my two eth. cards.... I think they hate each other and don't want to talk anymore :( They cut me off the internet everytime I try to bridge them... "Route" hangs when they're bridged. Help :'(
Can someone tell me how to set up my wireless network card? I coulnd't conncect to the internet when I booted up my PC with the Live cd.

pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (you can always find it in the channel topic, among other useful things)

Tonren, I am trying to install this card on a laptop for some ive crossed over to linux. she knows nothing. so I want it to be  easy. are you sure Network-Manager works with ndiswrapper ? i mean, once ndiswrapper is up and running does it function just like a native driver? As in, super easy config when swithcing APs and encryption.
{K}Lubby, sure you can.  use a usb stick or whatever
kk, so I go to login, and I get the message after typing my password...

so it *might* make a difference?
mikeg: sup?
{K}Lubby, yes, it's possible
{K}Lubby: it might.
Tonren:  id like to ask, what to do  if my ubuntu 6.06 does not detect my SATA drive
{K}Lubby, I'm not saying it is likely, but it is possible
cause it seems like since its off a cd it would, cause you obviously can't save stuff like gateway info onto a cd once it's already burned
{K}Lubby: Yea, you won't be able to edit system files like that.  But you should still be able to change network configurations

The problem I'm having with my ubuntu partition is that I already have some unallocated space on my darive, but for some reason i cannot increase the capacity of the Ubuntu partition using that unallocated space, i dont understand why. The partitioning program simply doesn't give me that option.
lxe, i happen to be root
aeread, you can't use mv to clobber a read only file even if you happen to be root
pushpop, yea but when it asked for a resolution setting like 15, 17 or 19 inch monitor
aeread, you can use cp, then delete the original one
oh my bad
chmod it?
odat: dont recall ill try again
aeread, or, you can rm the file before trying the mv  (remove the file by the same name in the target directory)
sethk: but then i would have to configure GRUB and everything again no?
heh nice, ubuntu basically has two passwords since it doesnt show your username like windows does
sethk: there are alot, i dont want to remove
but ill try to cp
toxicfume, no, as long as the designation of the /boot directory hasn't changed
Anybody knows how to make energy saving play nice? When I'm watching a movie I'd hope the monitor would stay on! I have to go to the control panel and disable it. (Running KDE... maybe this is not the place?)
thanks cp works
aeread, cp -f will work.  Of course, I'm assuming you know that it is safe to clobber all these things.  :)

toxicfume, I don't know what program you are using.  None of the linux partitioning programs allow resizing partitions.

{K}Lubby: while you wait for help in here, use google, / wiki.ubuntu.com / ubuntuforums.org

sethk: I'm using a program in windows xp actually (i'm aware of the fact that i might have to update grub after the partitioning in windows is finished)
KrisW: that's weird... I think that when you upgrade the old kernel still shows up
yeah lxe, that's the only thing i've tried (or know to try... im a complete ubuntu noob)
sethk: how to know if this chipset r supported?
mikeg, we need to find the name of the kernel module that supports that chipset (if it exists)
lxe: where's network-admin?
el_isma, there's a good possibility that I just don't know what I'm looking for
odat: the blue VGA cable is plugged into the blue VGA port on the video card.
{K}Lubby : and what happened after?
sethk:  how to find the kernel module then?
mikeg, I would start by looking in the Documentation subdirectory of the kernel source tree.  a google search is also sometimes helpful.
well, I tried apt-get dist-upgrade again and it picked up where it left off
el_isma2: just type in network-admin
so maybe it didn't finish last time

does anyone know of a way to install XAMPP (LAMPP) after installing Ubuntu Desktop 6.06?
so maybe the time-out caused it to not upgrade?
pushpop, the reason i am saying this is because if you have a add in video card then your probably have two different ports you monitor could go into too
lxe: i click the ethernet connection, hit properties, choose static ip, put in the settings i need for it to connect to my windows xp computer using crossover ethernet cable, hit okay, then hit the activate button *ping* then the error comes up
odat: the X800 is PCI Express, is PCI:1:0:0 the right identifier for PCI express?

KrisW: To know which kernel are you running, do a "cat /proc/version". Dapper has 2.6.15.

el_isma2, I've seen the stuff about LAMP, but I'm looking for an easier way.  I figured since XAMPP comes in the server distro it should be pretty easy, but on the server disk, I can't find a .deb that installs it.  For that matter, I can't even find XAMPP on the server disk.  It's just an option at install time.
{K}Lubby: and try every option, even using dhcp on network-admin
sethk: okay lets say i copy my entire / from my current partition to a new/bigger partition..how do I make it so that the new partition will also be /dev/hda4 (which it is right now)?
CVirus then do: apt-get update, or just go to synaptic or whatever you use and refresh

Shinzetsu: Odd, there's no package named anything like that in the command on the Pure Gnome page (which I've used myself).  When you boot your machine, do you get a login manager?
I already have dual head setup, in fact, Xchat is runnin in the second monitor. I just want to extend the task barto cover both monitors.
have you never tried xinerama?
what command do i do to find out what 2 days and 9 hours from now is?
how can one make two monitors get treated like one wide monitor, so that maximizing a window, for instance, causes it to span both monitors?
i was SAYING THAT!! it will BURN but not BOOT... ENGLISH!!! ITS CALLED ENGLISH!!
Good evening, I have a question, I'm running a dual head setup and Gnome as Desktop Environment. I would like for the application taskbar to extend the second monitor. Any ideas? I can create a new panel and move it to the other monitor, but only to put quick launch applications in there.

zoidberg: pcmcia is a special slot used in laptops, not an issue if you have a desktop
sethk: error removing
Shinzetsu: Then you may want to boot to single user mode and run "dpkg-reconfigure gdm" and tell the system you want to use gdm over kdm.  We know that kdm is broken, but perhaps gdm is working.  I don't know if dpkg will allow you to do that with a broken package system, but it's something to try to get your display working.  Once you're back in gnome, we can troubleshoot further.
darth_gimp, thats fine same kernel source code
Shinzetsu, you'll have to use some of the force-xxxx flags with dpkg do get yourself going again.
Unless sethk has some ideas that are more helpful.
noiesmo, thanks...

!root > Talisker
but after relogin the password reset itself to the old one
you just have to unlock sudo
gdb: yes
Talisker: that should tell you
DamianFinol: ok will try.. tahnk you sir
gdb: should I try installing kubuntu and ubuntu, then reconfiguring xserver to have gdm as default?
Hello everyone, I developed a new file manager for GNOME and need testers. Anyone can help?
ok, so there's a different way to get a sudo password?
Shinzetsu: Ok, you've already run the commands to remove all of xubuntu-desktop from the Pure Gnome page, right?
[I tried adding myself to the sudoers]
Shinzetsu: theres a file somewhere that says what the default login manager is

darth_gimp: (thats actually a symlink to it)
Talisker: your sudo password is your user password
oh rly\?
NickGarvey, its not there...

Heh, I never noticed that since they are the same on my machine
hi.. Im having a trouble with firefox.. ti crashes in some sites.. some one can help me?
Shinzetsu: Hrm, odd, I can only surmise that you cut and pasted, perhaps, both commands rather then one at a time.
gdb: try and apt-get install gdm ubuntu-desktop?
You've been much help, thanks

Anyway, you've been much help, thanks
did you check the folder?

anyone: i'm trying to get apache2 to parse php scripts after being processed, but it only allows them to be saved.  if the code is embedded in an html file, it works.  any ideas?
Talisker, use 'sudo passwd root' and set a root password
Talisker: You set a root password, that means you have a root account ;)  unless you've since disabled it
I never realised it was because they are the same on my machine
Talisker,  There, you got a root accoun tnow
Well, g2g, thanks
It's sudo asking if you're really Talisker before letting you run things as root.
Talisker: but its not a good idea to do sudo passwd root
:-)
can you add files to apache without being at the server? do it thru a network?
stopher: yeah.. ftp it up then use ssh to move it..
stopher, ftp or ssh?

DamianFinol: I made the foledr in my hoem dir.
stopher: or you could set up nfs to mount your apache dir (is what I do)
stopher: You can also use an SMB mount and use the Windows file manager to access your pages without logging into the server itself.

what is FTP passwd?
darth_gimp: eek
stopher: Ah, well, doing that is going to be problematic.  You may want to make those files owned by your normal user account.  Then you'll want to use System -> Administration -> Shared Folders to share /var/www.  Then you will need to run "smbpasswd -a username" to add yourself to the smbpasswd file.  After you're done, you can mount the folder as a disk with Windows using \\server\name_used_in_the_control_panel
darth_gimp: 2 things
jamesrk, Edit your fstab like this:  /dev/sda1       /windows/       ntfs umask=1000 0       0
DamianFinol: ok..a nd how do i do/get/see that? :P sorry for all my stupid question..^
err jamie

fstab is what?

Shinzetsu: Ah, great!  Now you can boot into the desktop but /quit in irssi to exit it, and "exit" at the root prompt.  Once you're bck in here, we can work on making sure that KDE and XFCE are completely gone.
_lemsx1_ what?
Shinzetsu: sure thing!
corevette, Easily? boot windows recovery, and type: fixmbr then resize or delete the linux partitions

ftp not working Flannel
apt-get install proftpd - I've never used it, but perhaps another can give instructions on how to give ftp access to /var/www using it.

darth_gimp: perhaps a forum would help, but I doubt anyone in here right now will be able to help you out

Flannel: That's the crazy thing: There is no file, and there's no mention of it anywhere in my Maildir. It's a phantom folder!
Shinzetsu: sweet!  Now, do you want to make sure all of KDE and XFCE are removed or are you good to go for now?
stopher: I would just use nfs and mount it on your local system
DamianFinol: Well, because we're still using a monolithic kernel, if a device driver goes crazy, it could require a reboot

NickGarvey, I just did that and then re-did the "apt-get install linux-source"
hey thanks mate

Anyone D-Link 650+ working with WEP? works fine if I disable the wep key inside the router..
would anybody mind helping a new linux user set up his ventrilo server?"
Anyone have any idea why moving files from my linux partition to a FAT32 external would keep cutting out after a couple files?
[Nige] : Copy/move/link a script to /etc/init.d/<scriptname>, give it executable permissions, and run "sudo update-rc.d add <scriptname> defaults"
Panserbjorn: you're run out of diskspace?
yes DE, I downloaded something to my desktop and I need to copy it over to my /usr/share/amsn/skins folder
but I have mo permissions
sudo <command>
thanks DarkElf109
bbrazil: Nope, 253GB free
i will give it a gao
!sudo > rast4
Panserbjorn: files under 2GB?
aye, mp3s
DarkElf109: What do you mean ill need restriced drivers?
like wlan-linux?
sometimes a whole folder will transfer
how do I make XMMS my standar player?
ty I will look
for mp3's
Panserbjorn: what error is it giving?
right click an mp3, change it i think
Jamie: similar to windows, double click a .mp3 file and tell it to always open with xmms
bbrazil: no error, moving window just disappears
k0shi: Some drivers are proprietary...and therefore not included by default for legal reasons

i am one lucky bugger. spilt a doc. pepper on my laptop 2 days ago. working just fine today
Ideally I would like to upgrade the dist. Haven't used Linux in a while
tuxvix: curl and wget both won't work when sshing, you want scp

Hi everyone, I swtiched to GNU/Linux -Ubuntu dapper a few days ago. I'm having problems with dosemu. Did anyone here install it from Synaptic?
nobody knows about tablet pcs?
cdew4545: I have been using Ubuntu since Hoary, on 11 machines. I also build computers, install Ubuntu and donate them.. I've not had to compile anything yet :)
one_stinky_bum: i reckon most would work fine
one_stinky_bum: no man. not this guy at least
ok
Stegozor: its in multiverse assuming you have that enabled it should just install
ardchoille:  probably jsut my lack of experience with linux and installing files....I have my computer in a location where i have to have wireless internet and i havent gotten that to work for ubuntu yet so i have to run windows for everything basically
Has anyone here ever tired palying Xvid?
but I currently have the gateway m280
stegozor I could not get dosemu to work but I did get dosbox to work
the digitizer doesn't work
cdew4545: Dlink DWL-520?
yes morphix
I was looking for a tablet pc that would work best out of the box with 6.06
I was going to sell my gateway

I have the m685 -- it works nicely.

so does anybody have any idea why lidvdcss unscrambles my dvd fine, but there's still no sound?
I can't tell if ubuntu has safely halted or not, and it is still a bother with the power not turning off because then I have to pull the plug every time

=== loopout [n=loopout@24-55-98-109.clspco.adelphia.net]  has joined #ubuntu
erisco: the kernel you are using probably doesn't have the correct power management functions compiled in, if this is a stock ubuntu kernel, your choices are to install your own outside the package manager, roll your own package, look for someone else to give you a package (if they have fixed a similar issue), or deal with it....  depending on your level of motivation and technical skill (I may have missed an approach)
yossman: Windows doesn't recognize the drive now either
erisco, so yea maybe ubuntu doesn't know your system's particular APM management
genpatton, and it won't, no
erisco, actually heh that might be it, if your system uses APM instead of ACPI that could be a problem
gutano yossman, so my solutions are to find what my APM management version or type is
erisco, do a search on ubuntuforums.org for your motherboard
brand, model
see if anyone else has similar issues
erisco: yeah thats a tough one, that might even be a kernel problem. does dmesg give any clues?
you could also expand that search to google.com

is there a way to have different wallpapers on each desktop?
Tonren, I am trying to get a log of what is happening when my computer shuts down
tonren: thanks again, bye

CAn I run X more than once?
I.e. can I run X on F7 and F8?
Jbirk: sure
wow
How can I do that?
erisco: To navigate less, use J and K to go up and down.  Hit / to search for a string.  g brings you to the top of the document, and G brings you to the bottom.
Tonren, the wtmp file seems to be binary... this certainly isn't what I was going for
how do I get the current version of an installed package out of apt-get?
Sorry to bother you guys, but I really need help.
morphix, i think u meant 386
not 686
where can I find a log of installed packages?
like what the last ones were?
should i get a hp or lenovo?
lenovo
there we go.
working now i think
ibm/lenovo pwn
erisco: Ah, I see.  wtmp isn't a log, but a special file used by the BIOS (I presume) to figure out how to boot up again.

=== onelife151 [n=onelife1@69.45.122.102]  has joined #ubuntu
can someone help me with the installation of an application?
majd_: There is your problem!  When you try to access a computer using the WAN (public) IP, the router doesn't know which computer to forward the request to.
morning
jbroome, there is no central log for apt?
what application in partiuclar
onelife151: jahshaka
Tonren, but i made port 93 forward to my ubuntu machine
majd_: There are two solutions.  1) Connect using your LAN IP (the one starting with 192.168), or 2) Set up port forwarding on your router.  Since you are just testing, 1 is --  ah.
majd_: So, what error message do you get?
majd_: do you have sshd listening on 93?
sftp is ssh right?
u run the sudo apt-get install jahshaka up to the end
hey anyone expert in fonts in here
majd_: You may also be experiencing problems because sometimes, when you try to access your public IP address, your DNS server says, "That's yourself, you jerk," and you never actually get to the router.  In other words, sometimes it "Defualts" to localhost.
but cannot find it anywhere
majd_: if ur modem/router has a built in firewall it might block u trying to get back through ur network, since its similar activity to that of a land attack
i need to change the console fonts in here
Flannel, in my router's settings, i have app 'ssh' forwarding ports 91-95 to my local ip

the problem is

i can't test it
visham: You can change them in gnome-terminal, but I don't nkow about gdm off.  Why do you need to change the font?

ardchoille: I also have the .deb file, but must learn how to compile it

majd_: is transmit a ssh client? ;)

are you trying to find it on your local machine, or the interweb?
total_meltdown, hooked the speaker up directly and it works fine
the web
the app is called kpgp
had it on suse
hey folks, does anyone know if there is anyplace I can download the ubuntu edgy eft gnome themes?
emachine_: hmm... so it's not a hardware issue... what were you doing when it stopped working?
swim_ ask in #ubuntu+1
thx
does any body know were i can d/l kpgp for  dapper
amicrawle: there's a package called tkpgp in the apt repository, is that what you're looking for?
yes

it never asks during the install.
emachine_: Ah, the joys of Linux and hardware support. My sound wasn't working for the longest time, turns out it was because I had the output channel 'external amplifier' unmuted, and it was fscking up other things. Could there be some similar channel that's pwning your Line in Channel?

!tell toaks about sudo
toaks: use sudo
tell me about sudo!
JoseStefan: Op! I beat you
total_meltdown, not on my screen
!tell oaks about sudo
toaks: http://www.google.com/search?q=sudo
!sudo
sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
ok
clarence: if you know how to chroot; or get linux32 package
wait... !tell is a command, isn't it...
!info lnux32
Package lnux32 does not exist in any distro I know
!info linux32
linux32: Wrapper to set the execution domain. In component main, is extra. Version 1-3 (dapper), package size 5 kB, installed size 56 kB
so why would there not be a root user created on install?
I was thinking of 'Don't tell him about sudo'
isnt that a bit strange?
Healot: no i dont but i got wine installed
toaks: It's a security bonus. Typing 'sudo' every time makes you think about what you're doing before you go and type 'rm -rf /*' into a root shell
fair enuf.
You get used to it fairly quickly
ok

i had a biege g3 AIO running i think it was osX 1.4.7
I made a few videos on a Mac, and then I made one on Windows. There is no comparison. Like... you can't explain it until you've done it... but Macs just butsecks everyone when it comes to art anything
I need to make a partition just for GRUB, how big do I need to make the partition?

mneptok, Great, now... how do I install grub to that partition>
hmmm
?
my X is half arse locked up
MTecknology: type in grub
britt: I have a Gateway laptop with Linux (1.5 Ghz Celeron, 512 MB ram), a Desktop with Windows (Games only) and 3 old 133 Mhz PCs that I use as project computers. Right now they're unsucessfully trying to play nice together and be a cluster...
PsychoTheRapist, hang on a sec
MTecknology: you label it /boot during installationm
-m

total_meltdown: a cluster :o
britt: kinda

memtester - A utility for testing the memory subsystem
damn I forgot... I use vesa drivers... gaming prolly won't work for me :(
what is the difference???
right now it's more of just a big pile of fun-looking hardware. It does stuff too... sometimes
mneptok, britt, I don't know how to install grub by itself

britt: I asked that earlier - I wanna try to get OpenMosix running on them so it acts as SMP, but so far no good
MTecknology: during install, manually partition the drive and tell the installer your nice 75MB ext3 partition is /boot
total_meltdown: how are they connected? 10/100 is a HUGE bottleneck
hey quick question
mneptok, I'm not installing linux
you'd need like firewire connection or something
OpenMosix is only avaliable for the 2.4 kernel, but Ubuntu runs the 2.6. I've tried some of the Instant-cluster solutions, but they don't like my hardware

MTecknology - so u didnt have dual boot right?
alex222 and I have a difference of opinions
:)
is there a guitar tab maker and reader for ubuntu?
mkquist, I did, but now i don't
i really like the simplicity of xfce though...
britt: you could kick up the volatge and overclock that sucker

KDE4 will be nice though.
MTecknology - ok , so when u installed ubuntu did u move windows?
gnometab?

MTecknology - so its still on same part...
k I'll check that
i wish i could.
sorry - keep forgetting there's a million people in the room..
_X-ray_, take a look at the packages that agnula-demudi installs on its base system, their website lists all the packages and what they're used for, I used the list to add about 30 packages to my ubuntu box
mkquist, no, part was formatted
MTecknology - but after windows right?
MTecknology: if you resized partitions, there is a very good chance that your Linux installtion is gone. which means you *will* be installing it again.
_X-ray: in the add/remove applications - just throw "guitar" in the searchbox
3 results :) - 2 involving tabs
i also have a 1.6ghz p4 (or maybe 1.8Ghz) on a DDR board. this might be faster?

oh well... meanwhile I'm having a good time listening to Altar :D

any one know what package I need?
plus it's HAWT!
any one know what package I need? configure: error: No curses header-files found
MTecknology, if you just need to write an MBR I can help you work with grub's command line. The menu.lst file for grub will have to be accurate, and you'll have to know the device you want to write the MBR to
MTecknology: if you want to restore a Windows MBR just boot the Windows CD to a recovery shell and type "fdisk /mbr"
the only bits i love in KDE, are: 1. Katapult, and 2. the public file server applet
hi guys..whats the difference of the "search foo.com" and "domain foo.com" in the resolv.conf

you can turn ubuntu into kubuntu just by installing kde ;)

there has to be a way
because NTFS is a trade secret

Nul1: PartitionMagic or somesuch
Nul1: a nuke will definately
Nul1: you can use qtparted or gparted
im gonna google that
I would stay away from parted
i like to keep my PC maintained... well atleast my operating system... does ubuntu have programs such as disk clean up and defragmenter?
and NTFS resizing
partitionmagic works great
from personal disk-destroying experience.
britt: I think it might be, but it's like running Windows ME. You -can- but when something breaks and you lose everything you care about, nobody will feel sorry for you
the liveCD has either qtparted (kubuntu) or gparted (ubuntu)

hey guys I just tried installing jEdit via a devian package and it failed installing and failed trying to remove itself so I went back to the site and added the repository to my sources.list to install via apt and ran 'apt-get update' and now when I try to install via apt I get the following error: "E: The package jedit needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it."
what does this mean and how do I get jEdit installed?
is my BusID incorrect or something? how do I find the correct one?

I can set the mtu size via # ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492 but where does one set the MTU size permanently?

fyrestrt:scp? (sorry if im pissing you off, i dont really know anything about profptd)
Ueah I thought that /etc/networking/interfaces

AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.

Hi... I need to compile a program, but Ubunto 6,06 cant find the make utility running Terminal. I guess I have to install teh make/compiler somehow, but is this package a part of the distro or do I need to find it online somewhere???

The only solution I have found is to give the root user a password and I'm trying to buy into this whole sudo thing

Is there a way to tell the OS that it isn't in fact writeprotected? Or is that something the hardware is enforcing for some reason? (this is on vmware)

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=luxi+sans&btnG=Google+Search

no matter what .sh file i try to install

arrenlex: what is a segmentation fault?
bruenig: It's fantastic when you don't want anything to work!
now im worried
a segmentation fault is when a program has a major error
zspada15_: It's when you try to access memory in an illegal manner.
a segfault is a program error
such that the OS kills it
zspada15_: where memory tries to access a memory segment it shouldn't
.sh files used to be easy to install wah wah
newbuntu: is this a new machine?
a stupid coder, essentially
some help with NFS this is my /etc/exports   -> /home/javier/shared 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,async,insecure,all_squash,anonuid =1000,anongid=1000)    I get syntax error
newish install
do we still use memory management with segments?
zspada15_: For example: int i; i = "Hello"; <--- segfault
I thought that was an antiquated idea
mebaran151: virtual segments
zspada15_: Another way to cause it is to try to write to read-only memory.
neil_edgy: the hardware?
ah
yes 1 to 2 year old machine
arrenlex: like kernel memory?
each program has a "segment" of memory it can access
mebaran151: It's old terminology that has stuck around despite not applying anymore.
but the kernel doesn't have to load pages, etc

levander, it is best that you install it separately. When I did use it, I installed it separately. There are just too many permission issues because azureus likes to write and add stuff to its installed directory instead of putting it all in a home configuration directory. I found that to be a  big issue

hi, i installed the xfce4 package with all it's dependancies, how do i uninstall it all?
if it was only heck, that doesn't sound so bad
zaatar: what tool did you use to install it?
levander, synaptic
zaatar: i'd guess synaptic does orphan tracking, but i'm not sure
zaatar: maybe someone in here knows how you could "simulate" a remove with synaptic to see what packages would be removed if you were to do it...

You have to forward within the script, open port - then portforward it
elysium444: you need to go into the router's administration panel via the browser and often need to set a static ip.
bruenig: no, that is not the issue.  The issue is that *.java is mapped to text/x-csrc

anyone know why gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" gives no such file or directory ?
I'm fairly inexperienced with Linux.  I have an Ubuntu server set up and I log into it using SSH to mess with SAMBA settings, etc using Putty - how can I copy files from it to my Windows machine via remote login?
JoshJ: i meant to bjames :)
hmmmm
OrangeOrange: I found drivers on intels website regarding the 945, you have the 950, it might be worth a shot, but I really can't help much past that, not the best with integrated video
tim167: because there's no cdromupgrade dir in /cdrom ?
also gksu sh is a mixup
=== synth7 [n=j@cpe-075-176-031-121.carolina.res.rr.com]  has joined #ubuntu
you should be doing sudo sh whatever
stefg: Technically... I could just swap the cables for a simple fix :-D, just no 5.1 until Q2 of XFi Drivers for Linux
JoshJ: no, you shouldn't do that even.
bjames: putty supports scp.  for more fun, install cygwin on yer windows box to turn it into a fake unix box
JoshJ, given a process P, 'kill -STOP P; kill -CONT P' then killing the controlling terminal leaves the process running in the background.
I have /media/cdrom-1, which contains the Edgy Alternate install cd, and I tried /cdrom-1 too
JoshJ: sudo -i is the correct method
ah, right
JoshJ: i mean gksu "sh /cdrom-1/cdromupgrade"
MerlynC: you have to investigate which modules are actually loaded (lsmod) and compare that to a list of modules which are known to be needed. More time-consuming tahn i can spend ATM
mnoir: I don't particularly want a Linux environment on the Windows box
how do I use scp?

Evening people - quick question though not directly Ubuntu related
ShadowX, the biggest thing to understand is that you install EVERYTHING either via Add/Remove under the Applications menu or via Synaptic (System - Admin. - Synaptic)

is their any Linux version of Visual Basic?

everything worked almost perfect, but when i updated the system and kernel it stopped working
gaspipe1: note that, it's -l (small L) , not -L
Gorlist: VB is made by Microsoft, do you think they'd make a Linux version?

crake: or if you want to be "logged in as root" type sudo su

To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - See also !fuse

kiamo: here, I found this for you: wget -q http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/medibuntu-key.gpg

ok I am trying to move files from 1 hd to another.  I have chown to reflect root, but the group remains 1000.   I am trying copy or  ctrl- but I cant paste it in the new directory. Anysuggestions?
try looking in Xchat options :P

How do I activate AIGLX in Ubuntu 6.10?
!aiglx | ferret_0567__
ferret_0567__: AIGLX (Accelerated Indirect GLX) is an open source project founded by the X.Org Foundation and the Fedora Core Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering capabilities to X.org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol. Head to #ubuntu-xgl for support.
are you sure you want AIGLX?
xtknight, 64 bit firefox, i think, not ultra sure but 64 sounds familiar.
Any problems specific to Ubuntu?
ferret_0567__: for nvidia you should just use the builtin nvidia compositor, im not sure about ati
I have NVIDIA
ferret_0567__: dont bother with aiglx.  use nvidia's builtin pixmap compositing thing with Beryl

worldedit: we put an & at the end so it didn't hang up the terminal.  normally when you execute stuff it's synchronous, that means it freezes the terminal until that command completes.  gedit does not complete until you close it, so your terminal will be frozen while you're reading the readme.  you dont want that, so you append the "&" operator to make the terminal usable and so the terminal doesnt wait for gedit to close until yo
u can type again

for playing dvd?

Hi all, I'm trying to figure out my routing table and why it doesn't work. I have two nic's on different networks. Both have a default gw. But whatever I do I can't seem to use the "other" gw?!

so I reverted back and than it works

I'll just bite the bullet and reinstall and rich: yes I did
okay
hey does anyone know what glibc is
ok
and how to update it
jsut checking
paiiiiii: 'lsb_release -a' should tell you.
but reinstalling seems to be easier than figuring out what I put in the pastebin
you can try updating it by sudo apt-get dist-upgrad
but like i said not recommended :)
ok
<--- still noob
pbureau: Won't it just be modprobe'd next startup?

Greetings :) I'm trying to install the avidemux_2.3.0-0.0ubuntu1_i386.deb that I downloaded and it says: "Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libasound2" but libasound2 is installed and already the newest version??? what's up with that?
whats this location  ~/.xchat ?

Does the 6.10 server disk install gnome?
arrenlex: ok, ok
mike01: cool ^_^
_`XeOn_, if you have a ~/.xchat, that's either a mistake or leftover from a really old xchat
heh heh was just playing with the tux game... its pretty cool
arrenlex: I hope you aren't giving instructions for upgrading to Edgy.
ardchoille: Sorry, thus: http://68.148.168.84:8001/b
mike01: I never used dvorak before
how can i find the mounted devices and their rexpective points in linux?
_`XeOn_, only place should be ~/.xchat2
dvorak7min doesn't have enough with all the keys tho
i downloaded chanserv.py
mike01: I would go insane, I think
Jordan_U: No. ardchoille says that if they'd run an apt-get upgrade with debian repos in the sources, they would reinstall.
you should try it when you don't have to do a lot of typing

Can I make ubuntu unload my wlan driver before hibernating, and loading it after resuming? I've got a problem with my ipw3945 not properly "powering up" after a hibernate: The device is there and everything, but it doesn't automatically associate with any WLAN. (And I can't seem to get it to do so by /etc/init.d/networking restart or ifdn eth1 && ifup eth1)
ducky: looks like the script is trying to do a chmod on a file it cannot find, is it possible it has gone into a different location?
frogzoo: thanks
Anyone know of a reliable text editor that has the ability to edit files through ftp? I've tried using curlftpfs to no success. I can connect and mount an ftp site, but as soon as I get a few levels into my site structure, it hangs. I've tried jedit which works until I try to load a file to edit. Am I going to have to run dreamweaver in wine?

ardchoille, not that I cling to my position, but I enabled the debian repositories to install Scribus. Nothing else seems bad except for those 2 packages, "deskbar-applet", and "serpentine", which is a CD writer.
pseudomorph: I just tried again like you said with the .deb from that page and this time... low and behold.. it seems to have installed.
_`XeOn_, wait, are you trying to install chanserv.py and it's telling you to edit something?
Is it possible to remove libasound2 and then install the deb, or is that a bad idea?
yeah lol
cod1: I'd be amazed if emacs wouldn't handle it
it said to be placed in ~/.xchat2
agliv5, it's probably not a recent enough version
lgc: a) Isn't scribus in the ubuntu repositories? b) Couldn't you have compiled it instead? Or found a package?
ducky: yep, looks like the script couldnt find the package... this should be all you're missing
mike01: though I like the idea of dvorak, wish they thought of it earlier, so it would be stander
yeah its been around since the 30s
_`XeOn_, okay, so that's where you put it
arrenlex, it wasn't when I installed it, in October.
eternalswd, you wouldn't happen to know a good source?
lgc: you enabled main though, so that means that any packages that were newer in debian were installed from the debian repo automatically, and that could be a lot of packages
mike01: lol
pseudomorph: Wow, working now... thanks so much, brother!

mencoder does everything he he he
zYe: I.E. Mencoder is exactly what it says -- an encoder. i.e. you can reencode a movie, or apply video filters, or cut it, or pull it up, or other technical things. But you can't splice a clip of your horse onto a clip of your daughter and add shiny text.
zYe: Also, mencoder is commandline

agliv5, if you download http://cs.wheaton.edu/~mbucy/files/spidermonkey.tar.bz2 and untar to your home directory, you can add --with-jsapi-include=/home/`echo $USER`/js and avidemux should compile.  let me know if it doesn't

yes
but one is mac
and this one is.. well it uses windows xp
like im used too
and i have no idea how to use mac
ok are you trying to use wireless or wired?
They're ethernet cables. If they fit, they'll work.
ahm
dezinezan, you'd need a switch or a router.  (another piece of hardware) since most DSL modems double as single-port routers, you can likely go the cheaper route and just pick up a switch for about $20USD.
the router my mom got says wireless
mmhmm
=== PlanarPlatypus [n=alucard@81-179-83-59.dsl.pipex.com]  has joined #ubuntu

Well, if you look on the back of the router, ther'll be plugins like the ones on the back of your computer.
L8R all
check the bottom of the DSL modem itself.  it'll say if it's a router or not.

dezinezan, do you know if the Mac has a wireless network adapter installed?
On the back of your router, should be three or four plugs close to eachother, with another plug off to the left sorta by itself.
ok i have the modem that CAME to set up the highspeed DSL, then the other day we bought a D-Link  Wireless Router

if your mac doesn't have a wireless adapter, you can't connect wirelessly

can someone plz tell me what file to edit to change my locale
dezinezan, excellent.  ok, all you need to do is plug an ethernet cable between the mac and the router, and the rest should be pie.   (however, you might want to check the model of your mac on the apple website, it likely has a wireless adapter built-in.)

dezinizan, you can plug a cable from your modem into the LAN slot. That'll give the internet to your router. Then you can plug one computer into the 1 slot, and another computer into the 2 slot.

that's a very crucial step.
actually i unplugged EVERYTHING and stuck with JUST the modem for now until i could find further help
zezinezan, if everything is connected right, it should automatically be connected. No dial in required.

I think you gotta have firefox 2 though, for that.
Rajiv2: AH!  You just reminded me of the olden days, which I won't get into lest I date myself, but that really just means you need to find out with that proper init string for the modem is.
AmaroqWolf, or the tab mix plus plugin.
rc-1, it'd also be a good idea to install noscript and only allow trusted sites to run javascript.  that'll kill a bunch of the problems
grol, iirc, g-132 was even supported by bsd
Amaranth, yes i do that, but when i do it reloads the crashing site

eternalswd, thanks i wish there was a better way though :( whats the command to remove flash? (i cant use firefox to lookup! :(
rc-1, then uninstall it, install flashblock and reinstall it, then you should have control over what flash content is actually used.
n4cht is there anyway I can get a hold of you I have to go out for a meeting
AmaroqWolf: You have to unmount the drive.  :)
I like Kubuntu but if it can't get me online its pointless
rc-1, did you install from the repository?
AzMoo, did it crash your firefox too (if that was it)

Hey all.. Got a question, it is SSH/PuTTY related.  In putty, you can open a SOCKS port that is available to outside users by clicking an option off in tunnels.  I have gotten it to listen locally manually using ssh by doing 'ssh -D#### hostname' then I can use #### as a proxy, but how do I make it available to ALL users on my network like Putty

soundray: Ok - looks like my init.d/widescreen script is executed too late. How would I change the boot priority?
ddude, these apps are kernel-specific, they must be installed for each kernel.  If this is a problem, stick with one kernel and only change for major releases.
any idea why sudo or gdebi-gtk would do something like that? lock up my soundcard?
can I manually run that on a already running system to detect new external drives and have the folders and mounts created?
it locked up my soundcard :/
