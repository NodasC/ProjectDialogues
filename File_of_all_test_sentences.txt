Amaranth, the US peer is probably breaking the law
but an ES or NL peer downloading it not
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8419601/
the US peer is just stupid for wanting to share movies in the first place
The downloader is breaking the implicit rules of good netizenship though :)
why cant you just buy the full quality dvd from a shop?
i buy my music off iTunes (support the artists, easier) and watch movies in the theater (their entertainment system is nicer than mine)
IceDC571: that's his business :P
the US peer is breaking US law, of course
Seveas, check the link, people in netherlands got rolled on too
IceDC571: are you really doing that question ? maybe becuase it's not cheap ?
anyway, this is all highly off-topic and is actually one of the banned topics, so yeah
hehe ok
monchichi, those aren't downloaders, but crackers :)
Amaranth: would libdvdcss2 be illegal in the US?
true, but they targeted crackers because they cant possibly target all the downloaders
decss i mean
yes
canada too
and much of the EU
Amaranth, well, to be really strict: this kind of discussion is not one of the 'banned topics' since we're not supporting people trying to do illegal things ;)
Ok ok, U have great theaters with a brand new movie playing .. but here...
can anybody help me see a dvd on linux?
so how do I view dvds in linux legally? pshh..
IceDC571: You pay $30 for this program that only works on one version of one distro.
Amaranth: whats that?
=== nitroXL [~tekkno@BSN-77-45-12.dsl.siol.net]  has joined #ubuntu
IceDC571: No idea.
IceDC571: The distro is turbolinux, iirc.
monchichi: maybe it was illegal to distribute the things but not to download them ?
i dont really watch dvds on the computer anyway
so i guess im good
you can watch dvds in linux legally by paying a royalty
actually I belive some distros distribuced some parts of libdvdcss that are legal
so that you can play dvd but not rip it
libdvdcss is not legal at all
AMaranth: talk with linspire about that :P
Edulix: They're nuts.
lol.. linspire wont be legal for long..
Breaking the encryption to play a movie is just as illegal as breaking the encryption to rip a movie.
i cant believe walmart gave in to their deal
IceDC571: I think that if they do that it's because it's legal, and they are surely more informed than me, I don't know about you...
Edulix: No, the guy that started linspire just likes to piss big people off.
linspire has been in court several times
who owns the css license?
me
dvdcca
can i watch the movies i bought?
pllleease?
the css? i have no idea, decss.. no one

theres things you arent supposed to reverse engineer due to copyright laws
well, i suppose you could try to get in on the DMCA's reverse engineering clause, but no one has successfully done so yet
openoffice format isnt a reversed engineered word format, they're different
ailean, maybe, but US law is fucked up
i know
because it is encrypted it's evil
plus iirc illegally releasing a trade secret doesn't make it lose it's trade secret status
IceDC571: if it isn't reverse enginereed then how did they achieve that ?

Edulix: They took the key out of a player
after that people figured out how to generate keys

jeroen_: Not sure about that.
jeroen_: at least the encription can't be strong, because it's not allowed (in the US) :P
linuxnewbie, then add the users that you want access to the "networking" group
cion: firewall should already be running (iptables)
Edulix: strong encryption is legal
ICE: what do u mean?
Edulix, but if you're not allowed to crack it, it's still a problem, no matter how weak
jeroen_: well of course
adobe used rot13 and sucessfully used the DMCA to stop people 'cracking' it

=== Jad [~Jad@86.108.12.106]  has joined #Ubuntu

curut, amsn is written in the tcl/tk language.

jeroen_, oo ty the recommended section in the amsn web?
pack=package
jsimmons, maybe, but just use dpkg -i

LinuxNewbie: no, it's automatic. You can manage installed packages using Synaptic Package Manager, or you can do it with the command line. If you use the command line, apt-cache is the command to search through the local database (or cache) of the list of packages that you can install over the net.
where is the Xorg.log located?
after upgrading to breezy
markuman, then you can use ati, if you want to use the nonfree driver you can find out your kernel version with uname -r and search for linux-restricted-modules-... install those with your kernelversion at the end

rasputnik: I've usually let ipcop deal with firewall/packet forwarding issues for me. Perhaps today I will learn how to do it myself
with linux, you can pull any component out, look at it, fix it, config it, etc.
sktrdie: use aptitude, its better for back-dependencies, you should do "sudo aptitude search whatyoursearching"
so a: windows is simply a poor set of tools
sktrdie: then "sudo aptitude install therightname"
but it also is b: a set of gui wizards that automate most basic tasks
enrico: I think that my X is configured properly, I would like to reinstall it.. how do I do it
the consequence of b: is that people are tricked into thinking that its okay to be stupid and ignorant
sktrdie: reinstall it or just reconfigure it?
reisntall
that you can operate something as complicated as an os with no training / learning /thinking at all
sktrdie: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg for reconfiguring
and that simply is not true
Will__:  I confess I've never done it in Linux land (I'm a BSD guy, I've only just come back to Linux). But the priciples involved are universal
so yes, some windows users are put off by linux, primarily because they can no longer be lazy
will some one give me help to configer my cd player
=== Fanskapet [~din@h112n1fls303o1124.telia.com]  has joined #ubuntu
enrico: reinstall?
it's a combination of primarily those two that make microsoft a hazard to everyone
sktrdie: and "sudo aptitude remove xserver-xorg; sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg"
ok can firestarter monitor the website visited on each computer
otherwise its a company of some very smart and talented people
rasputnik: I'm BSD also. I turned to ubuntu as...Linux makes a nicer desktop. I can see my BSD server from here. It needs to connect to the net though this box though
I've heared there would be some problems when i remove sudo, is it true? i don't like to use sudo...
or buy each log in to samba?
by i mean
LinuxNewbie: What was your original problem? I think I walked in half-way though this
enrico: ok I'll try that... but yet if i try doing apt-get install mplayer, it installs mplayer, but I dunno how to open it, If I do mpalyer in terminal it wont work
holycow: but a lot of people just want to Get Things Done, don't they? I don't think it's fair to expect them to be gurus. M$ main failing is that they pretend you don't need to know anything
sktrdie: try mplayer --help
ok will now
Originoo - I don't like to lock my front door, but I got used to it.  you sould keep using sudo untill you get used to it
sktrdie: I thought the package was mplayer-386 ?
sktrdie: never used it.
enrico: It doesnt find
rasputnik, then they shouldn't promise them the world, and lock the thing down
sktrdie: ahh ok, so its not installed.
Originoo: You could use su. Maybe setup a shortcut to a root terminal?
no i never used sktrdie
sktrdie: maybe you mispelled the package name .. search the right name .. with "sudo aptitude search mplayer"
i am trying it now
rasputnik, as well, 'just works' and 'just get something done' is highly subjective
Will__: I'd say they should either sell a black box or a hacker toy, instead of requiring Grannies to understand the danger of DLL conflicts
a programmers definition of a workflow that fits that will be entirely different from a graphic designers
as well as a system administrators
enrico: ok the one I isntalled is mplayer-powerpc
the problem is not 'just get it done', the problem is the user is taught that they can be a system administrator
but if I type "mplayer-powerpc
enrico: nothing happens
is there a software in linux can act up like users can log in to ubuntu ang monitor what they are doing?
sktrdie: type "mplay" and the press tab
"sudo aptitude search mplayer" this does not mach any thing
and a system administrator, like say any other specialty, like a mechanic or a doctor, requires training and knowledge
Windows isn't that difficult to use or configure. You can do some great things. But it is harder to really understand.
enrico: nope
holycow: I'm really talking about end users who just want a platform to run their life on, be it web/mail/doc editing or CAD
holycow has a point. I think people are mislead into thinking they can do everything, easily
i.e. you are either a user or an administrator, just don't like to the user that they can be administrators by merely buying a licence to run an os
rasputnik, exactly.  but thats just one workflow.
Should I be drinking 6 shots of espresso for lunch?
o well... enrico: also sound isnt working :(
there is no software that can monitor the client computers
enrico: also do you know where the kernel is located in Ubuntu? I thought it was always /usr/src/linux
like what they are doing, what website they are in
as a user that wants that workflow to 'just work' he should buy a preinstalled system, installed by someone who knows, managed by someone who understands
sktrdie: hoary?
a user without training has no business installing software, setting up firewalls, etc.
yea
sorry i could not find mplayer
i realize i'm stating it too black and white, there are shades of grey here, but system administration is not a joke
holycow: but that's true in all OSes, isn't it? you can be clueless on any platform :)
try typing alsamixer
its not something you pick up on a weekend
rasputnik, right exactly
:)
enrico: that works... I mean if i open XMMS it only runs with the eSound Output Plugin
sktrdie: and check for wolumes
enrico: but If i select ALSA it doesnt' work

and the botnets are the resulting consequence imho
"sktrdie" where do i find this

o well i need to test X now...

hiya, anyone know how to close pesky java applet windows that dont want to close?
and I'd also add that if you are incompetent using word, you get a shit cv. if you are incompetent and firewall admin, the consequences are more serious

=== stig_ [~stig@dsl-121-26.oeke.tiscali.no]  has joined #ubuntu
how can I get access to my NTFS files from ubuntu? (fresh newbie asking) :)
stig_, unfortunately for now it requires a bit of work
a: you will only be able to read the ntfs files
b) you wont be able to write to an ntfs partition
I only need to read from it :)
ms keeps ntfs info secret, and any interim support for write has essentially dissapeared as no one cares enough to maintain the components
okay
then
hmmm hang on
may have solved this
brb
1. you need to find your ntfs partition with sudo fdisk -l
=== fge [~insomniac@fge.user]  has left #ubuntu ["May]
2. you need to create a folder in say /media to wher eyou will mount to the ntfs partition ... mine is /media/ntfs
3. you need to add info about the partition to your /etc/fstab
stig_ the ubuntuguide.org is really good on this
i'll paste a sample that i use
oh i don't have the line on this system
holycow: I think I made it it point 3... but dont know how I do that
google for fstab mount ntfs ... you will get lots of examples of the entry
the 4. sudo mount /media/ntfs
ok, thanks
=== [noobuntu]  [~chris@dsl-082-082-220-126.arcor-ip.net]  has joined #ubuntu

a disk with NTFS file system. Tried /dev/hd1, but couldn't open it :/

It is detected, the leds are all happy and stuff
Albaraha: ok, now type 'apt-cache show splashy' and note the dependencies. where are you getting splashy from anyway?
narkceh, because you're trying to open /etc/modules as a regular user. what you're doing is essentially running "echo fglrx" with sudo and redirecting it to /etc/modules. You should run "sudo -s" or "sudo su -" and then run "echo fglrx >> /etc/modules"
however, iwconfig gives me a "NOT READY!"
CarlFK: is this an install or the LiveCD? sorry lost you in the scrollback
=== chaitat [~chaitat@gb.jb.70.95.revip.asianet.co.th]  has joined #ubuntu
narkceh - either the "enter password" is being >> to something you don't have rights to yet, or the sudo only applies to the echo fglrx
delire - install
CarlFK: do you have another Linux box around? perhaps you can ssh into it
delire, Yeah, it's nice. I can't use my infrared before that though, but I haven't been able to do that before either, so it's not much of a problem. I might install vanilla Debian or something to see if it works while waiting.
CarlFK: CarlFK: also note the other boot options
delire, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=41709

delire - but if I let it boot, no ssh
narkceh, I do the same thing all the time. It's a bit non-intuitive I guess, but makes sense. :-)
so, qnyone on wireless with a prism45 ?
CarlFK: right, well the thing to check is 'cat /etc/X11/Xorg.0.log | grep EE' to look for errors

CarlFK: hmm, that looks like the culprit
but I don't have a touchpad.. I have the nub in the keyboard

does beryl have to be sudo'd?

Jowi: i didnt say it was not able to be done
AIGLX

un_operateur: I have gnash working in FF but not in Konq...
jordo23, errm, wait -- first lets explore if gnash works? does it work ok on 64 bit firefox?
gnomefreak: He said he installed it, or tried to
un_operateur: yes....finally
Jordan_U: it wont run on dapper
=== habtool [n=clive@86.41.204.248]  has joined #ubuntu

Jordan_U: you cant install it nor compile it without compiling all xorg packages
un_operateur: and I tested it on several flash test sites....oddly though adobe.com does not work... ;)
clayg, did you modify /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf-custom?
jordo23, ok, can you verify if konqueror has a plugins directory -- i dont use knoq so bear with me -- i think - ls -l /usr/lib/knoqueror
and its a bit shakey than too
Jowi, yes
gnomefreak, there are repos for aiglx

hey .... I've just realized that Ubuntu's grub really sucks!

patrick_, start "gnome-colume-control" and go to capture tab and untick that little red cross on the mic. then turn the volume meter of it way up.
barata: In what way?
gkjones_: i suppose it could work with xgl
Always a good reason Azul. Just trying to understand as a noob. :)
Azul, yes its much better has got me out of a bind a few times when apt-get just couldn't get it
Azul, I wouldnt call aptitude's ncurses interface graphical -- and it also has a command line interface almost fully compatible with apt-get
you just cannot chroot and fix the grub after windoz stole it ....
jowi, i have done that but still nothing
!metacity
metacity: A lightweight GTK2 based Window Manager. In component main, is optional. Version 1:2.16.3-0ubuntu2 (edgy), package size 385 kB, installed size 764 kB
can some one remind me how to get a gpgkey for apt or synaptic?
for sure using that 6.0.6 live CD just doesnt work
should i remove older tcl & tk packages first?
patrick_, and if you click on the Options tab. what is the input source?
un_operateur: It says it wants to install a ton of files, like 184 MB worth, is this normal?
!grub | barata Yes you can
barata Yes you can: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
jowi, i only have 3 controls too. if i plug a mic and headphones in before i boot, it gives me a couple more options but still doesnt help
so nautilus is the file manager, metacity is the window manager ... Interesting.

jaydedrag0n_girl, it surely doesn't make you stupid. but saying annoyed-sounding things like "i know my way round ubuntu, k?" to people who're trying to help sounds arrogant. not stupid, just arrogant.

hanyou: im not the most knowledgable about these things, but I have heard that routers can block individual ports
openmindDJ: Its in the Nautilus preferences.
haha
ohh yea....
ToddEDM: and I was lucky enough to find someone to help when I was sitting there where you are <smile>
hmm well rhythmbox and amarok are acting funny...i can play a song, but when i switch to a different song it freezes
ok i got all that installed on the desktop.. and restarted xinetd
danbhfive: Went through that with the laptop. All that was left when I was done was me to terminal into my Cisco Gateway and rewrite my routing table.
yeah i thank you thor
jrib; Oh! Thanks!
ToddEDM: old age and experience :P
ToddEDM: now try ssh to the desktop from the laptop...
remember when it asks to use the pw you have on the desktop...not the laptop
i need some help getting trash can and showdesktop on avant dock
Thanks Pici, can;t believe I forgot that!
cool i think that worked
ToddEDM: it gets better...stick with me
or a good irc channel where I could talk to some networking gurus as my question isn't specific to ubuntu...
hey, is there a way to go back to a previouse state of ubuntu?
haha right on
hiii
restore...
kakoonia: reinstall old one :P lol
jomknjoip
ToddEDM: if you look around you will see you are now on the desktop...you see the desktop file structure. Every command you enter there will occur on teh desktop...not the laptop
mnklnion
thor , you realize, now i will be looking for you EVERYTIME i have a problem!
kakoonia: dont suppose you made any backups
kakoonia: like downgrading version? no
danbhfive: I'm pretty swift when it comes to anything PC or Apple related, but this has me tied upside down on a freeway overpass.
jrib: Any way I can copy all of those files?
jack
ToddEDM: and most importantly...everything you do is via ssh...and encrypted channel...so it is about as safe as it can get
kakoonia: you could clean install but that's not typical meaning of downgrade in the usual sense
cool
ToddEDM: we will make it a little safer later...
ToddEDM: now...when you are done....type 'exit' and you should return to the laptop prompt
ToddEDM: take your time
jimjam: you can use -exec cp (see examples in find's man page) or pipe to  xargs cp

=== Amaranth_ is now known as Amaranth
I could swear this is caused by the linux-kernel-rt: "There was an error starting GNOME settings daemon... will try to restart the next time you log in." I have two computers that started doing this after upgrading to the real-time kernel. Anyone know what's going on?
=== Varka_ is now known as Varka
im not meaning downgrade, i tried to fix something with my laptop screen, so i did some bad adjustments.. now.. i got some bad things going on reboot and resolution got bad.. so i was wondering if theres a way to go back to a previouse state of this installation that worked fine...
ghgf
Just installed Gutsy - I thought this version was supposed to have complete/easier support for configuring xorg? I'm still stuck at a refresh rate of 50Hz.
Is anyone using the real-time kernel?
stodge: are you using nvidia?
yes
stodge: use dpkg-reconfigure and enter the refresh rates for your monitor
there is a bug in the nvidia drivers concerning refresh rates
ToddEDM: remember...you can open several terminals so you can compare what you are doing on the desktop to what you have on the laptop (if you are so inclined)
compiz works a treat though with minimal work, which was nice
jack_sparrow: I thought that was supposed to be a thing of the past?
ToddEDM: you can even open several ssh sessions to the desktop...although that would be redundant and repetitive
im not meaning downgrade, i tried to fix something with my laptop screen, so i did some bad adjustments.. now.. i got some bad things going on reboot and resolution got bad.. so i was wondering if theres a way to go back to a previouse state of this installation that worked fine...??
i've got a problem with networking.
stodge: I have to edit my xorg.conf to get proper refresh rate.
stodge: If it dosent setup your hardware you still need to do it manually
sorry for sounding so newbish, but what am i supposed to do on the desktop?
:(
ToddEDM: nothing...you do it all from the laptop...that is the point
yeah thats what i meant
ubuntu is NOT giving itself an ip address, even though i specifically told it to do so
stodge: the nvidia driver scrambles the refresh rate information, so if you are using the driver, the wrong refreshes will get reported
i just wanan print a doc
ah ok
stodge: i have the same problem
ToddEDM: for instance, if you type 'mkdir /home/ToddEDM/temp' it will make the directory on the desktop...not on the laptop...even though you are typing on the laptop
kakoonia: oh, probably your xorg.conf
ping
I have the horiz and vert values set in xorg.conf
pinging doesn't work since it doesnt have an IP
kakoonia: you could try doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg to possibly regenerate the default config
everything is just lost
i want print/my/damn/document
no route to host, etc
lol

danbhfive: I don't think it has anything to do with vid card.... I could be wrong but I don't think so.
does ubuntu have a registrey
tuxthepenguin533: not really
cyzie:  yes
tuxthepenguin533: no
tuxthepenguin533, no
hanyou: yeah, I dont think i can help much more
God I love virtualbox
ToddEDM, so setup it then, it's easy
tuxthepenguin533: GConf is about the closest thing to one, and its hardly a registry
then where do configs go
it is
ToddEDM: when you are ready...log out of the desktop
anyone here good with networks?
scguy318: No. gnome uses a registry-like system called gconf, but its very organized
tuxthepenguin533: files
kakoonia: wut
ToddEDM: and log back in with 'ssh -X ipaddress'
i want to extract an osx .dmg to get at a graphics file. can i do this in ubuntu?
scguy318 is xserver-xorg a part of the command?
Galatea2: just ask.
Pici: I meant in the Window sense :)
hanyou: it is interesting, your pings are getting stopped at a certain spot
kakoonia: yes
ToddEDM: that is an uppercase X
hi
k
kakoonia: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
whats kde use then like gconf

why can't ubuntu just work?
kakoonia: after doing that try restarting X
danbhfive: As I said, samn thing with the computer I am typing on right now earlier today. Then, poof, magic it works. Wierd......
Galatea2, it does for me
cyzie...nothing...we got the printer working and now I am showing him how to control the desktop without having to be in front of it
Galatea2, why nto ?
cyzie:  i want to print a doc. with my desktop... im on my laptop
is it me,  or does compiz manage to work better with ubuntu/gnome?
why can't windows just work?
where do the files get stored
because one moment ago
no no thor, it hasnt printed yet
...
tuxthepenguin533: everything is in your home dir
thor, many ways then, ssh and vnc, rdesktop is a few ways
i was transferring files from this laptop to the computer running ubuntu
through a physical network link
ok
the next second, i return, and it refuses to connect
ToddEDM, easy, 1st ssh to your desktop, do the lp command
ToddEDM: should...you said you found the printer in cups on the laptop...so it should be in the printer menu when you print from a program
anybody know static routing?
danbhfive: Just wish there was someone in here that knew exactly what my problem was.
PeteOnline: what about it?
or a good channel to ask that same question in?
ztomic: i filed a bug report because I couldn't select a valid refresh rate, even though it was in my xorg.cong, and the guy told me it was a bug in the nvidia driver, it sounded like that guy was having the same problem, but for sure, i still cant select a refresh rate  :)
and now using ifconfig -a
PeteOnline: whats your question on it
my network does not contain an inet entry
PeteOnline: This channel is as good as any go.
Assid: I've been trying to wrap my head around it basically.  To actually understand it
Galatea2, dhcp ?
ToddEDM: the ssh stuff is so you can install and config programs without having to sit in front of the computer...sorry...got ahead of the game
yes
danbhfive: hmm... interesting.
"roaming mode"
I get ip addressing and subnetting and all
and this computer is configured with a static IP
Galatea2, do a networking restart
PeteOnline: very very simple.. think of the destiantion ip address as a destination on a map
thor:  thats ok... that was good info
how do i do that?
the route itself as different routes to that location
Galatea2, /etc/init.d/networking restart in root
just updated GPSD ... gpsdrive don't work no more
ToddEDM: if you open the document on your laptop, when you go to print it, you should find the network printer on the drop down menu
ok i see the printer when im printing from openoffice
if you hve a multi homed network, then you basically choose which netwrok you want to use to reach that destination
yes i see it thor
hi
ToddEDM: ok...does it print?
okay let's see now
i need help
no, it sits in queue
nope, still not there
I understand the idea behind static routing, but the way you enter static routes on most consumer grade routers confuses me
how to get more bright  in ubuntu  ?
PeteOnline: Go to https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/internet/C/networking-enable.html#networking-enable-nm
if you wanna go to florida from newyork, then you choose a route for the whole state of florida.. and not just cape canaveral
ToddEDM: is it in the queue on the laptop or the desktop?
Does anyone know why my display still suspends after 10 minutes even though I've turned it off in Screensaver and Power Management? It's quite annoying when watching videos (shouldn't video players disable this anyway?)
haha it woulda been funny if i said YA IT PRINTS
ToddEDM: use the 'lpq' command on both machines
anybody have some extensive knowledge about windows?
in fact, now i can't even select the radio button in the network menu near the clock thing
rhythmbox keeps on crashing when i manually select a song...anyone know wtf is up with it?
PeteOnline: That is the Ubuntu Documentation on manual config and such.
PeteOnline: just read up on subnet masks.. that should easily clear it for you
lpq: error - no default destination available.
anybody who uses gpsd ?
Galatea2, i have never get any porblem on that
(the radio button which corresponds with my network)
ToddEDM: was that on the desktop or the laptop?
well maybe you're lucky :(
billy: can i ask why you are asking about windows in the ubuntu channel?
both
just wondering :p
Galatea2, not lucky u dumb

cause my windows isnt booting

I am brand new to Ubuntu.  I have been running PCLinuxOS for about 9 months.  I'm having some issues with Grub.  Is this the right place to ask for help?
how so?
okay so, does compiz somehow work better on gnome for some stupid reason? or is that just me
I have read up on subnet masks, how it bitwise masks the ip address to discern the network portion and the host portion, etc
billy: is it not in your grub menu?
you see, if i was to connect to it wirelessly though the house's router, it connects to my shared folder almost instantly
Galatea2, what do YOU mean how ?
well its in the menu
when when i boot it
yup... im printing a test doc right now thor
well, what do you want me to check, cyzie?
it loads the welcome page, then restarts
from the Desktop
ToddEDM: from the desktop, right?
yes
no help on GNOME Settings Manager?
it's just weird how it's not the same for when you use a physical connection
Anyone here know how to use rn?
I need a guru
ToddEDM: when it is done...try printing the test document from the laptop using cups
billy: when you load into ubuntu and check the file directories.. is everything seemingly in order? or are your folders empty?
Galatea2, go to /etc/network check the interfaces entry
well lemme try this question: I have an ubuntu server behind a router and I want to give it an external static ip through the router
ToddEDM: and you did add the network printer on the laptop using cups, right?
Galatea2, dont enable wireless and ethernet at the same time
If I want to start reading usenet posts on a certain server, how would I set up "rn" to do this? I want to connect to news://freenews.netfront.net

scguy318: i ran this gdb thing and i got this Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
Galatea2, u can either disable physically or through the OS
what is this "partition has been mounted several times check forced"?
billy: okay windows was already broken before you installed ubuntu i have this correct?
okay i'll do that
PeteOnline: nope. you can't do two. but you may forward from other server or set up individual ports from the router.
billy: Then please refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base or call their customer support.

is it possible to install ubuntu to fat32

that's all there is in interface

wrong entry Galatea2
hi, whenever i try to do a sudo command with & it just skips over the password prompt and cancels the command, how do i do this
ToddEDM: once you have both queues cleared...open cups on the laptop and go to the Printers tab
that is why your networking fuckup
heh yeah
Galatea2, what did u do ?
it's /etc/network/interface, right?
nothing
were allowed to swear
Galatea2, no
as i said, i returned and then it wouldn't work
no not really
it's /etc/network/interfaces
oh ok
well yes that's what i meant

Hanyou: well, hehe, I don't know,  I'm a total noob at this, but im using wireshark,     It just seemed like a next step for you
i'll do it now
thor, yes, but i believe i gave her admin privleges
Galatea2, u can type my name, so easier to see here
watch the packets from another computer
ToddEDM: ok...clear the queue on the laptop as well...
hold on
ztomic: unfortunatley, the same port is going to be used on 2 different machines behind the router
ToddEDM: then open cups in the browser on the laptop
danbhfive: I will try that, though I doubt it will help me much.
PeteOnline: thats a predicament.
hold on a sec... walmart photo just called , i gotta call my wifey

Marcusklaas: no Aero tho :P
Marcusklaas: now...can you emulate a more serious disease <smile>
aero = ??
PeteOnline: put a switch between the modem and the router. set up the servers on the switch and the other computers on the router.
Marcusklaas: the fancy Vista 3D
oh lol :(
thor:  ok cups is open on the laptop
Marcusklaas: 3D typically doesn't work on VMs, hard to virtualize

i need some help getting trash can and showdesktop on avant dock, anyone??
This is honestly about to make me cry.
ok
i heard there's a very lean version of ubuntu of vmware integrated .. liek 300 MBs big
set printer options
ok
ToddEDM: make sure they are ok
thor, how do u know if ToddEDM know how to make sure? he is newbie
controlled by printout mode....
cyzie...they are page length and such...would be specific to his setup
ztomic: I was thinking of doing that, but I also need to use it locally, inside the router
it all looks good thor
error policy is retry-job

can anyone recommend a good screen video capture program for ubuntu?
hey scguy318: can i do the glassy window look tho?
PeteOnline: that's where you're gonna have to set up static routing and I don't know how.
Marcusklaas, yes
cyzie...they aren;t real important right now...would just mess up the format
ah cool
where can i configure that?
cyzie...I wanted him to know they are there

right.
thor, hehe. yes, show the kiddie
yes also it says published thor

not screen shot
ztomic: i have that figured out, my question is more on the router's side, which I realise isn't really this channel's purpose
Grav3Mind: ah...you did say video, my apologies...don't know there
ok i see something i idnt notice before, which i shoulda, its in big bold type ....Unable to connect to CIFS host, will retry in 60 seconds...
lol sorry robdig....
ToddEDM: really...that means it can't get to the desktop...are you running firewalls?
Galatea2, good to go now ?
it's possible to run keyboard events from bash terminal?
PeteOnline: yeah, i hear you. I'v never done it. probably set your servers up to receive from IP and the router to static route to an ip. I dunno.
ToddEDM:...wait...check this....
thor, maybe on my router
ToddEDM: on the printers tab...click on Modify Printer
nope
is it possible
Galatea2, ?
that i just add my own entry
ToddEDM: no...the router would only be firewalled to the internet
Galatea2, how?
Galatea2, yes
k
I'm looking at an emacs interface for the first time because i want to learn to use 'r' and I'm told ESS (emacs speaks statistics) is the way to go, but I am really displeased with the display. It looks bad, like what gnucash looked like in Feisty. Any ideas on improving font rendering, at the very least?
ToddEDM:click on Modify Printer, then Click on Continue...
ztomic: yeah, I think we both have the same level of knowledge on this, neither of us know how to do static routing on the router.  blind leading the blind and all
anyone know of a good VIDEO screen capture program
like, i'd just write iface eth0 inet static
hehe
whats a good lightweight Mplayer GUI?
this shouldnt be happening though
thor ok
ubuntu is just meant to work without a hitch
and it does
Galatea2, yes, then u need to insert the ip ssubnet mask and gw
ToddEDM: Make sure the device is right...I think it should be AppSocket/HP Direct
yeah
Any ideas what I'm missing:  undefined reference to `XPending'
hi
no1 knows?
Hi. does anyone have a minute to answer some Ub. Ser. 7.10 questions?
thor:  it was windows printer via samba
i changed it
Galatea2, yes, ubuntu work out of the box unless u go mess it up and that u dont know what u are doin
!ask | vee_
vee_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
ToddEDM: you may have to play with those to see which driver works
hehe
i have a problem. when i move icons on desktops , it makes copy instead of just move it
thanx
ok np
first involves RAID 1
I used my BIOS to set up a RAID 1
Hi, I can't boot Ubuntu 7.10 a 500Mhz G3 iMac because the machine will power off 3 seconds after yaboot. I tried passing "video=ofonly", but that results in an empty black screen.
ToddEDM: I am running a Canon iP90 on ubuntu and that is what I needed for my laptop
well i didn't touch anything at all!
ArthurArchnix: you can install emacs 23 from http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/
I was hoping this would make things easier.
this is frustrating. ubuntu isn't meant to destroy the network after i leave for a few minutes
ToddEDM: once you have it changed (try the AppSocket) click continue and see if the device url is OK
When I went to install 7.10 - it saw two disks instead of 1
ToddEDM: oops...hold on
So I choose the first
=== _RvGaTe is now known as RvGaTe
How do you go about disabling a piece of hardware in your system?
PeteOnline: you may be able to install extra nic's on the servers and connect them to the router but that defeats the purpose of wide area network.
Can anyone help me with my GRUB issue, or point me to a GRUB support channel please?
Galatea2, no it wont, i been running ubuntu like >100 days, no problem on my networking
kelsin: Beauty. Thanks.
I wasn't really expecting anyone here to know static routing, I was more hoping someone knew a good irc channel I could go bug
scott__: whats your issue?
ToddEDM: no...it should be Windows/Samba...I was looking at the wrong machine...sorry
but why am i the unfortunate one?
extra cost too but nics are cheap
installation said it was finished and now- I have the reboot and selct proper Boot Device...message
if u are not the one who is change it, then have u look into other possiblity?
ToddEDM: on the next page you should see the device url
what did I do wrong?
like software that change it ?
yeah, i might just do that in the end, but static routing through the router and locking down that specific ip address would be best
ok
DCC SEND "itsabeautifuldaythesunisshiningifeelgoodnobodyisgoingtoletmedown" 0 0 0 0 0
nobody have an idea ?
PeteOnline, don't the linksys routers have good config software, which handles all that?
make sure the device url is something like...'smb://192.168.1.xxx/name' where name is the name of the printer
I had PCLOS on my primary HD.  I added another HD and installed ubuntu.  Ubuntu works but i can't boot into my PCLOS.  I get Error 11 unrecognized device string
thor smb://MSHOME/PC-HOME/printer
hmmmm
why does eth0 broadcast an ipv6 address, but not an ipv4?
ToddEDM: nope...your desktop is linux, right?
danbhfive: I'm using dd-wrt, custom firmware installed on a linksys
scott__: when grub loads, i presume its when you boot your ubuntu drive first, right?
yeah!!
i see
usd to be windows
and what's the difference between eth0 and eth0:avah
ArthurArchnix: you can install the emacs-snapshot-gtk official package just to get gtk widgets, but that package from that blog also includes nice XFT font support
The working Grub is on the new hard drive
Galatea2, fix yoru problem first.
ToddEDM: is the desktop named MSHOME?
Query: Gparted doesn't let me unmount my /dev/sda1 hard drive because other things are mounted to the same point, how do I get it so I can unmount it?
thor: no
Galatea2,  u are running away from your own problem
its wrong
well i've tried everything including setting my network to DHCP inside interfaces
ToddEDM: right...you need to change that...smb://ipaddress/name
I boot up and I get a grub menu to choose my OS.  Ubuntu and PCLOS are both on the list
ToddEDM: ipaddress is the ipaddress of the desktop, and name is the name you put into Samba on the desktop
scott__: ok, can you browse the old drive, and look at the grub menu config?  IF so, it will tell you what parameters it was using, and you can just set those perameters inside Ubuntu's grub menu.lst,
I am literally lost for ideas
vee_ i have no idea, but, I'm gona send you a webpage
ok
!raid > vee_
ToddEDM: sorry about this...I am usually better <smile>
ok.  I'll try that.  Thanks.
hey thhis is great thor thanks
PeteOnline: try some other channels... these guys are pretty specific in here. If it aint ubuntu, they don't know.
ok the mane i put in samba.......
name
okay
this is strange
ToddEDM: once you have the url set, click continue
interfaces is now devoid of the entry i put in, and saved
ToddEDM:choose the printer and click continue
yes- i went to that site already -- doesnt cover 71.0
i dont know thqat name i put in samba
71.0
or just don't care
ztomic: I tried networking, but it was like talking to a room full of statues
that definitely isn't normal.
ToddEDM: you should use the same driver you are using on the desktop
danbhfive: is RAID a bad idea?
danbhfive: Do you know how to disable a piece of hardware on gutsy? I have been looking in support docs and haven't found crap.
When I open menu.1st it opens read only.  Who do I get it to open as a read write?
Hello.. in which file should I define my EDITOR variable?
scott___: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
thor:  gimme an example of yours
scott__, sudo ?
how do i set off definitvly the bell ?
it beep on my computer
thanks.  I was opening from GUI
and it is annoying
neko, System>Preferences>Sound ?
ToddEDM: my printer is a canon pixma ip90...I use the driver for the iP2000 since there isn't one for the ip90
cool
oops i was meaning the Dvice U
RL
thanks pabix
URI
it seems as if ubuntu doesn't want me to network the two computers together
neko, welcome
oh...my device url is smb://192.168.0.xx/iP90
anyone here got avalaunch working?
ToddEDM: in samba on the server I called the printer iP90
vee_ i dunno, it sounds like a pain  :)
\\|//
{o/o}
anyone with another idea?
ToddEDM: just curious...did you install swat with samba?
hanyou: no i don't, im google'ing, have you tried ifdown?
thor:  no
ToddEDM: do yourself a favour...install swat
galatea2
danbhfive: so whast the best way to set up Linux so that it mirrors certain info two a second internal HD
you want to make samba network with them ?
hold on , im trying to figure out my URI
yes
i've done that
and i've transferred files between the two computers on several occasions
how the two computer get their IP ?
oh it have work in the past but no more now ?
this computer has an ip set up of 192.168.2.1
yes
man the live cd should use anti aliasing
the other one ?
and the other connects via "roaming mode"
anyone know where i can change this setting?
the fonts look too crappy
check with ifconfig it they are in the same network
which worked extremely well until an hour ago
eth0 is not assigned an ip
there's something ghostly called eth0:avah
okey 1 have an ip the other have none
ToddEDM: I used this link...  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=282096
which has an IP, but exists on a different subnet
Sorry to ask this but where could i find a background/wallpaper which is pretty representative of ubuntu's spirit? (something like the picture on the CD jackets). Need this for a presentation, thank you
K_Dallas: gnome-look.org
K_Dallas: try google images
thank you both
ToddEDM: if you can't figure out the printer name....you can find it easy wth swat
hanyou: for network devices, it looks like you could just use the gui under System > Administration > Network
Galatea2, google images is frustrating, most of the time
ok
okey so your main problem is that one of your computer is no more in your network ?
i decided to insult ubuntu by placing the leopard-beta "grass" desktop
its there away to to open with wine a .exe after double-click and not right-click open with wine? this what appear when i do a double-click .exe http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/5f8c9bb26f.png
yes, that's the problem neko
they're not "communicating" with each other
anyone?
why is fileserver trying to send me Fedora 8 so badly?
K_Dallas: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Official that can help, not backgrounds, but logos and stuff
first you really need to have your two computer in the same network
thanks kelsin
what the problem with the one that get no IP ?
vee_: sorry, i have never done raid myself, i personally just backup as i need to, but its really not that secure the way i do it
the problem is it's running ubuntu
problem indeed
ToddEDM: the other way to find the printer name is to look in the samba config file...but since I discovered swat I have never looked there...so don't even remember where to find it
vee_: in fact, i don't know much about backing up in ubuntu
how do i change the anti aliasing of the screen?
I know only two way to assign IP
Assid: go to system>preference>appearance>fonts
by hand
ok i got swat... how do i open it
yeah, by hand it doesn't work
or with a dhcp
and that doesn't work either
vee_: I did move /home to a certain partition, which is kinda a backup proceedure
in appearance prefs Assid? under fonts
ToddEDM: you installed swat on the desktop, right?
cvd: Have you looked at thunar file manager...
something went bad with /etc/network/interface
both
the net interface is  wifi  ?
and I have no idea how to fix it
on the computer that have the problem
no, its with a physical hardware link
ToddEDM: ok..on the laptop open a browser tab and for an address type 'ipaddress:901' the ipaddress of the desktop
thunar?
thanks
they're both connected though car5
cat5*
through*
cvd: Yes, like nautilus, but smaller and lighter
wifi works great
danbhfive: if it means avoiding headaches and trying to get thing to work right, I can have just two HDs and some sort of app that backs up when asked - does this sound like the better way to do it?
but its slow and the packet loss is substantial because the computer is in the backyard
you have a computer in the backyard too?
ToddEDM: did swat open or do we need to restart xinetd again?
vee_: one line in a cli will backup for you
yeah
i like gnome, .exe worked before, but now i dont know what happend i wont open with wine automatically
restart
i use it for timemachine and what not
Jack_Sparrow: please enlighten me!
just playin...
ToddEDM: sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd restart
vee_: you can install thunar with synaptic, aptitude or apt-get
vee_: well, as a fellow noob to this stuff, yes  :P
its actually my old computer which i gave to my rents because apparently ubuntu is easy to use
ToddEDM: on the desktop
ToddEDM: then refresh the browser page and see if swat loads (I hope)
vee_: i mean, if it aint working, and you can live without it, why bother, this is just MHO
but, upon reflection, it's starting to be (un) good
danbhfive: completely new to this stuff and want to make it easy yet efficient
okay, i may as well transfer files though the sneakernet
:( nope thor
this is ridiculous
thanks, bye.
?
vee_: yeah, if you are new, i would say, forget raid for now
ToddEDM: ok...you will have to take a look at the samba config. Research swat on ubuntu later...it is worth the trouble
danbhfive: i hear ya - just need the machine to serve as a LAMP and file server
ToddEDM: let me see if I can find the samba config
whats the equivalent command to use in ubuntu to chkdsk.. in windows i would "chkdsk g: /f" to fix a currupt drive.. but, how to do that in ubuntu ?
vee_: raid is not worth the effort...
vee_: i think raid is something thats a bit involved to setup, ie, get linux to recognize it on bootup
Jack_Sparrow: whats that line you mentioned or app?
fsck
I need help getting Internet Time working right in Ubuntu 7.10. Can anyone help me?
lashmoove
vee_: thunar file manager...  install with synaptic or apt-get or aptitude
danbhfive: yea, at the moment I installed the server addition and now it wont boot at all from the HD
thunar us a really great file manager
how do I turn off updatedb autorunning?
ToddEDM: ok.../etc/samba/smb.conf
peacho: whats going on?
ToddEDM: on the desktop...in a terminal type 'less /etc/samba/smb.conf'
how to check size of /home/user/  ? i want to do backup of it
hm netsrot. good question. I'd look in /etc/cron.d/
ToddEDM: you familiar with 'less'?
Jack_Sparrow thanx so much
np
haha not at all thor
user_: try a "du -hs" in your directory
=== |muelli| is now known as Muelli
When I open Time and Date Settings and change Configuration from Manual to "Keep Synchronized with Internet Servers" it tells me I must install NTP support.
netstrot: System > Preferences > Sessions
ToddEDM: it just lets you see the file...not edit it. Page down by hitting the spacebar, and back with the 'b' key
thanks
k
ToddEDM: look for the definition for the shared printer...the name you need is the name on the left side in square brackets [iP90]
user_ you can also
If I click Install, it sits there for a little while and then it doesn't seem to fix anything.
right click on nautilus
danbhfive: what did you pick (when installing) when it came to partioning? I think I am going to reinstall after I tell the BIOS to stop the RAID 1 and switch them both to act like IDE
kelsin: You know what it was? your second comment there started me looking through synaptic. The thing is I wanted ess, but when I selected that it installed emacs 21 as the dependency. Emacs 22's font rendering is fine, and is also available in the repository. As is the snapshots you mentioned. Now to see if ess is working with 22, and then if I can uninstall 21 without apt also removing ess. Sigh... :)
neko,  yes?
peacho: yes, you need NTP to sync. you can get it by typing in a terminal apt-get install ntp
ToddEDM: there should be a line in that section with the 'printer name='
for check a size of a folder
ArthurArchnix: yeah it can be slightly odd, but even if you have to remove all then install the snapshot package first, then the ess package you should be ok
hrmm.. stupid network isnt going on wifi
not in live cd mode atleast
the right click > properties
give you this info also
in nautilus
kelsin: Indeed. Well, thanks for the tips and such.
ArthurArchnix: np
Allo
vee_ well, I have 3 partitions i believe, swap, /home, and /
vee_ i use this as a desktop, and a hobby developement server with apache/php
i see [printers] and [print$] thor
i got problem with printing on ubuntu, the shared printer is on windows xp sp2, so sometime after print a lot of pages, then i can not do print, it's like the ubuntu not send print job to the XP, even i already restart the CUPS service (/etc/init.d/cupsys restart) the printer still no respond. Why that happen?
ToddEDM: right and you should also see a section where you defined the printer for sharing
should i upgrade my feisty (7.04) to 7.10 to solve this problem ?
neko,  thanks
hold on
ToddEDM it may be you never added the printer?
danbhfive: so new that im not sure what the difference is between the three . I have 2 SATA 500 Gb HDDs
ok thor, im on the desktop
does anyone here ever got same problem like me ? or you guys, have no problem with it
robdig: when I try to install this I get the following error: Package ntp is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
E: Package ntp has no installation candidate
danbhfive: i imagine home/ is for the OS
ToddEDM right...and looking at the smb.conf file, right?
user_: what problem are you having?
vee_ /home is for the user
danbhfive: not sure what swap is
vee_ whats this for?
peacho: let me double check the name...
vee_ how much ram do you have?
etc/samba/smb.conf
ok
LiMaO, sometime i can not print document to shared printer on xp :(
danbhfive: Remote and LAN file server and a LAMP test box
ToddEDM right. And you didn't edit this file at all, right?
ok
ram?
i just wonder does cups or smbfs have problem about stability connecting to windows xp shared printer
4 gigs
is there any issue about this?
thor:  im logged on as myself on the desktop right now... and i cant even get to lok at smb.conf
vee_ ok, forget about swap i think
ToddEDM you probably need to do an 'sudo less /etc/samba/smb.conf'
danbhfive: 2 ghz core 2 duo
vee_ especially if its only you using it
danbhfive: swap is like using HD for RAM?
you will never need swap
ya
kewl
im sure i have to assign some space to it, right?
no
peacho: yup, ntp is the package name. you might need to check that your sources are correct...system->administration->software sources and make sure all of the repositories are checked
ToddEDM did that work?
is there any software to restore deleted file on ubuntu ?
 CUPS printing.  See also the cupsaddsmb(8) manpage in the
# cupsys-client package.
;   printing = cups
;   printcap name = cups
oijojoijoij
danbhfive: I am going to erase my RAID and begin reinstalling, whe I get to partioning, I am going to ask what I should do - is that ok?
ToddEDM I don't think that will work...but try using the name cups in the url on the laptop
Under Gutsy, mplayer when using xv only shows green when playing videos. X11 is too slow to really use as an alternative. Ideas?
ToddEDM you remember where that is?
@robdig: Okay, so I'm on the Software Sources page and the only thing I see checked on the Ubuntu Software tabbed is Installable from CD/DVD. I take it I want to check all the "Downloadable from the Internet" boxes?
vee_ I think there is an option to have ubuntu figure out the partitioning for you
vee_ might as well start there
is it possible to change my screen resolution to something custom thats not listed in the app for screen res.
vee_ you can change it later with gparted, and not loose your information
on the cups page on the browser
?
?
peacho: yup
right
is there a way to "steal" the window manager from kde?
Hello I tried searching forums but couldn't find an answer - I installed vim-latexsuite using apt-get, but when I open a .tex file with gvim it doesn't load latexsuite
danbhfive: yes, the first option. going to erase the RAID 1 and resey the HDs to function as IDEs first
dont get why linux always uses only 60 hz for its screens for lcd's
and not 72/75 if the hardware supports it
vee_ yeah, in the bios
user_ you could try e2undel
I thinking of buying a new soundcard. I've read that some people recommend m-audio and other brands instead of Creative's soundcards, because they says they have better sound quality and so on. I want it to give me very nice and clear sound for music listening, in movies and games. kind of an allround-card. is it a creative card I should buy?
I guess that explains why I couldn't install programs from Add/Remove Programs either!
anyone here using X and have configured it to use 72/75hz for the video instead of 60 for LCD's ?
!alsa
If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
!sound
peacho: probably so
Assid: i may use 75hz if i want
Assid are you sure your lcd can go that high?
can the window manager be used in gnome? (ie.  different wallpaper for each desktop)
LiMaO: yeah it used to on win
The Screen Resolution app in system->preferences (in gnome) doesnt list the correct resolutions for my screen (its widescreen), so can i set it in another way?
(from kde)
Assid are you using nvidia?
Assid: i mean it works for me under linux
dont remember if it was 72/75
Hi, I'm running Apache 2 on Ubuntu Server 7.10 and I'm having problems trying to get it to execute cgi/perl scripts. I had this problem before and fixed it somehow. Does anyone know how I can fix it?
danbhfive: nah, ati radeon 9000 mobility
Assid: have you properly configured your monitor horizontal and vertical frequency ranges in xorg.conf ?
its a dell d600 latptop
reallyjoel are you using an nvidia?
LiMaO: just reinstalling (changing from kubuntu to ubuntu)
danbhfive, yes, 6800gt
Assid: also, if you go to System > Preferences > Screen Resolution, can't you change it there?
LiMaO: live cd shows me only 60hz
Assid: mine shows 50hz and 51hz.. if i choose 50, it'll work at 60hz, if i choose 51 it'll work at 75hz
I was wondering just yesterday if there would ever be a day that I will be so smart that I can edit xorg.conf  and know what I'm doing.
ToddEDM I once told a friend that I liked linux because it allows one to rediscover the joy of getting a printer to print 'hello'
thor i dont know wtf is wrong with this
LiMaO, try using the alternate install CD.
hrmm no such thing here
reallyjoel the nvidia drivers have a bug which scrambles the refresh rate listings, that might be your problem
keen101: uh? i don't need it. i have a working system =P
ToddEDM2:whats the matter? won't it take cups?
anyone know how to make a suggestion for ubotu?
robdig: It's installing now... :)
oh. well, it gives you more options...
its not doin anything
danbhfive, well if that bug spills over to screen resolutions, but the refresh rate works fine
anyone?
peacho: excellent
no, i think its just refresh rates
danbhfive, SHOULD 'Screen Resolution' app list widescreen res's?
ToddEDM here's the thing...you have almost everything right...but you don't have th eprinter shared via samba yet...that is where swat comes in. If you aren't too discouraged I can help you get that...we are close <smile>
reallyjoel: it should honestluy
widescreen is getting to be a norm now
robdig; It just finished and now works fine. Thanks for your help.
peacho: no prob, have a great evening
I mean, not should as in usability, but as in how its made currently
ToddEDM I am looking at this howto....http://linuxtnt.wordpress.com/2007/08/12/starting-swat-on-ubuntu/
I have a quick question here, when i use nvidia-settings to switch my screen from my laptop to my TV, How do I switch it back without restarting X?
reallyjoel are you switching monitors by chance?
i am very discouraged ... lemme have a look
ToddEDM2: you need to install one more thing according to that....
If anyone else has this problem, it's a known bug see bug #137205
ToddEDM2: do 'sudo apt-get install netkit-inetd' on the desktop
danbhfive, well yeah, but i switched gpu at the same time, from ati to nvidia, required an install of nvidia drivers and a reboot
hello
reallyjoel anyway, you can use the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org
used the proprietary drivers app for that
reallyjoel yeah, you need to reconfigure every time you switch monitors
danbhfive, is it scary?
i believe
do you spanish
ToddEDM2: according to the howto that should enable swat
reallyjoel not if you know the specs of your monitor, which it sounds like you do
ToddEDM2: my fault...I thought it was part of xinetd
help
ToddEDM2: when we get swat running...it will make samba a snap to configure
!spanish | ubuntu

Hey. I read somewhere about how Network Manager isnt that good, and there was an alternative. I forgot what the name was. IF anyone knows what I'm talking about, can you please tell me the name
ToddEDM2: just checking in my ubuntu  I don't see netkit-inetd
ok i did sudo apt-get install swat

got it on both laptop and desktop
ToddEDM2: ok...hang on a sec while I check for a better howto
ToddEDM2: ok...I was right...it is xinetd...check this url....https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Swat
is there any way i can change the status of a hidden directory (windows hidden directory) in ubuntu?

how to do clean uninstallation after i play enough with wine (apt-get install wine) ? i need to remove the software and all of wine configuration
ToddEDM2: is that you slipping over the brink?
Hey, does anyone here know anything about Wine? Their IRC is kinda dead.
del syetrbfbf
ok i think im gonna scrap this little excesize of the mind... i will just email the shit to the desktop... seems quicker
software
yes thor
ToddEDM2: if you get that one file created it should do the trick.
anyone know a decent dc++ client other than linux dc
danbhfive: I am at the point Guided, but which one ; entire disk / entire disk and set up LVM / entire disk and set up encrypted LVM? then theres the first- resize (which is prolly what i dont want) and manual
ToddEDM2: but if you want to let it go we can do that too.
=== reconnect is now known as recon0
ToddEDM2: bookmark the howto so you can find it tomorrow
ToddEDM2: when you access swat you will see what I meant...it makes samba SO easy
I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu?
vee_ dont you want the first?  I don't know, I always have chosen manual  :(
thor.. i got the file made, how do i save it ?
ToddEDM2: are you using nano?
yup
vee_ if you choose manual, all you need to do is have at least one partition marked as /
ToddEDM2: just hit control-X and it will prmpt if you want to save. Say yes and it will ask for the filename
ToddEDM2: no..it already knows the filename <smile>
I've just read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wxwidgets2.8/+bug/68792 about amue crashing all the time when updating.  What's the eta on a solution, anyone know?
danbhfive choosing manual
ToddEDM2: then 'sudo /usr/sbin/xinetd restart'
Whats an alternative network manager than network-manager?
ToddEDM2: then open the browser on the desktop and type 'localhost:901' for the url
robdig yeah, but some themes i installed crashed the window manager gnome and kde
So Apparently I don't have the 3D accelerator or something installed correctly on ubuntu... how would I go about installing that for a integrated intel graphics card?
:)
ToddEDM2: did you get it?
i neede to find a way to open my themes settings from a command
danbhfive: now i see Guided / Help partioneg below that are two SATA drives - one has a submenu
Is there another file sharing app that installs easily in Ubuntu?
danbhfive # 1 primary and #5 logical
anyone know the program name so i can launch the themes manager in ubuntu
yes thor
ToddEDM2: on the printers tab....
no im logged into some samba page
ToddEDM2: there is a drop down for Choose Printer
ohh ok
vee_ mmk, are they partitioned?
vee_ how much do you know about partitioning?
when it comes to linux - 0
you want me back in cups?
vee_ how about in windows? ie not linux?
ToddEDM2: no...we need to define the printer in samba first
ok
windows an d mac - yes
i want to backup /home/user  is this correct use this command: tar -czf user_backup.tar.gz /home/user
danbhfive: win and mac yes
ToddEDM2: in swat you should see eight icons at the top...if not then you didn't log in as an administrator
vee_ how would you partition in those cases
user_ probably not, i dont think that works
ToddEDM2: there should be Home-globals-shares-printers-etc
ok i didnt , i see 4
danbhfive, what is the correct one?
ToddEDM2: then close the page, open it again, and log in as an adminstrator
I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu?
vee_ i mean, im not sure if I know what you need, you could just format them both to ext3, set one to mount as / and the other to something like /media/other
danbhfive most of the available space would go to data, if I have two or more drives I drop my data from one HD to another
o i closed it, tried the other login/pass no go
whats the administrators login/pass????
user_ why are you backing up /home?
blkthndr: why are you trying to do that?
man
any ubuntu laptops in Canada?
this final release of ubuntu is messed up
ToddEDM2: in ubuntu the admin is the first user you define...who was first when you installed on the desktop?
danbhfive, i want to backup /home/user , not /home
i dont get anything while the machine starts
its for my mp3 player
no loader or anything
danbhfive: system then two partitions (equal in size but way bigger than system) for data
danbhfive, i want to re-install my ubuntu
danbhfive, upgrade it to 7.10
blkthndr: this is a foldaer that should not be hidden?
danbhfive, because right now i use 7.04
hmm. can anyone suggest me what ubuntu version i should stick with.  i have tried gutsy , feisty , on my desktop and they install by using safe graphics mode.  However when i try to use edgy eft i can not boot into install.  The system crashes and i hear a beep and screen goes black. (if any1 could shed some light on boot options to use with f6).  The reason i am doing this is because my ati AGP card is not supported in fesity and gutsy.
yes it should not be hidden
thor, i did that... gave me only 4 icons
err.. did someone screw up on the release?
blkthndr: is it hidden in windows?
the loader is just dead
yes its hidden in windows, i dont have windows to change the status though
vee_ well, if you mount one drive as /, basically everything will go there
ToddEDM2: then open a terminal....type 'passwd root' and give a password for root...I always do that when I first install for just these reasons
danbhfive: I will be placing my Mac and Windows files on the data partitions as well
Hello.  I'm attempting to install using a Xircom rbem56g cardbus ethernet adapter and network autoconfiguration will not assign it an IP.  I know it is a functional card, I've used it before in other distros.  ANy idea why it wouldn't work please?  I really can't install without getting this working.  :/
ToddEDM2: then log in with the user id 'root' and the password you just defined
PsyDeViL: well.. if youre going to go with an older version have you considered dapper? its the long term support version
vee_ are you dual booting? or try booting?
ToddEDM2: I have about five hours of notes about things to tell you....we need to continue this at another time <smile> (or via email)
ToddEDM2: let me know when you are logged into swat as root
PsyDeViL: id suggest you maybe just ebay the ati card though and buy a dirt cheap nvidia :)
k
the problem is that because it is a windows hidden file, my mp3 player cannot read it.
user_ do you want to be able to restore the files?
danbhfive: I would like one drive with a good size partition for system and apps, plus a much bigger portion for M and W data backup, while the other drive I want to store just M and W data
ToddEDM2: you have eight icons now?
yup
ToddEDM2: the printers icon....
k
danbhfive: i dont want to ever have a chance of messing up the system (ha)
ToddEDM2: check the drop down list for Choose Printer and see if one is defined
vee_ but are you dual booting?  i didnt think you were, are you talking about when you actually setup the ftp?
ToddEDM2: is there anything besides 'printers'?
Anybody know how to configure an ad hoc connection in gutsy?
blkthndr: that dont make sense. Does your mp3 player work with Linux/Ubuntu?
i'm having a lot of trouble with this, i had hda/sda1 = windows, hda/sda2 = storage, and hda/sda5 = linux partition... i installed XP over the vista partition, but now grub doesn't load at all
danbhfive: at this point no, in the future i will purchase a separate drive for that
before i was using grub to dual boot
no just printers, and mine is listed
yes it works fine
user_  sudo rsync -aS /home/<user>/. /<backup location>/.
if i change the boot partition i can't get linux to load at all, and i can't get grub to set up right using a live cd
slvmchn: When you install XP, it overwrites the MBR
danbhfive: i really want this machine to be a server (another ha)
cry0k1n3t1c: i am aware of this
cry0k1n3t1c: how do i reset it
ToddEDM2: what do yo mean yours is listed? Is there a printer there in the list? If so ....highlight it and click Choose Printer
vee_ then dont bother with partitioning much, you want to use ALL the space for linux
slvchn: Did you try to reinstall GRUB from the live CD?
=== matthew_ is now known as person
ok i did that thor
i use rockbox firmware on my mp3 player, when i boot the mp3 players original firmware it makes the music folder hidden, rockbox cannot find the hidden music folder
blkthndr: and copying the folder is unacceptable?
cry0k1n3t1c: yes but it gave me problems
OK...the important ones....
I could copy the folder but its a huge folder
ToddEDM2: path = /var/spool/samba
vee_ linux will be holding the files for other OS's, in fact, at this point, it doesnt matter
ToddEDM2: guest = ok
and the problem will create itself again in the future
ToddEDM2: printable=yes
blkthndr: I understand but it should be visible.
ToddEDM2: printer name (write that down!)
o crap
is there an admin?
ToddEDM2: browseable = yes
So, is it even possible to set up an Ad Hoc connection between 2 ubuntu computers?
any ideas y update manager cant fetch any repositories. eveythin comes back with a 404 error. I have a good network connection.
last time, i got banned from IRC for this
ToddEDM2: available=yes
danbhfive: ok, so should i click on each and partition the entire device
i think i may log off
ToddEDM2: that's it
ToddEDM2: what is the printer name?
can i change the printer name?
ToddEDM2: yup...if you want to
its visible to linux and ubuntu and a mac, rockbox does not see it becaues it is a windows hidden file.  when i had windows i could just unhide it, i can't do this using ubuntu because its not hidden to it
cry0k1n3t1c: i found some forum posts that showed how to set grub back up, by looking for stage1 boot whatever, and then when i do setup hd(0,0) or whatever the command is it starts to work but then says Errorr 22
psc_1200_series is what it is
ToddEDM2: make it whatever you like
vee_ yeah, just one big partition for now
ToddEDM2: then click Commit Changes at the top (near the drop down list)
cry0k1n3t1c: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Adhoc
danbhfive: creating new partition tables for each right now
vee_ you should just get things up and running as close as you can to how you want
ok done
vee_ you can worry about more fancy partitioning later
ToddEDM2: now you should be able to define that printer in cups on the laptop
danbhfive kewl
ok
ToddEDM2: you do remember the printer name I hope <smile>
blkthndr: that's a predicament.
Why doesn't the ubuntu install cd come with ping??  It's really hard to try to diagnose network issues without it and/or traceroute....
hello word
there are ways around it so i can access my music, but i just want to know if the problem can be fixed
hihi;]
sleep now
; ]
now i add printers , in cups on the laptop
?
people; ]
ToddEDM2: yup...you can add that printer in cups on the laptop
ToddEDM2: smb://ipaddress/name
anyone know how to put tibia on ubuntu
Also could someone point me towards a pcmcia ethernet card that's known to work with the installer?  I'm using a xircom_cb one which fails.
blkthndr: maybe you can be more specific. it does sound like a hardware issue that is solvable.
thanks pike just downloading dapper now
will give it a shot
ToddEDM2: and use the same printer driver you are using in the desktop. If you don't remember it you can access cups on the desktop and look...just don't change it on the desktop as it is working
err.. wtf is wrong with the default live cd installation of ubuntu?
danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk
i dont see the loading progress bar
just a blank black while ubuntu loads
its just that i downloaded edgy livecd and it wont install. - the reason i am going to old version is so i can use my gfx card.
but I'm at a loss as to why someone would hide a music folder.
hey I need to get into just the command prompt
Its not a hardware issue.  I'm just trying to change the hidden status of a folder, the problem is its a windows hidden folder and not a linux hidden folder
Shadow147: just open a terminal
bloody useless channel..
Hi all! Which download manager is the best in Ubuntu?
thor I need to stop gnome
Shadow147: or press Alt-Ctrl-F2
blkthndr: there-in lies the problem
lets hope this works.. wifey is home now
Shadow147: A-C-F2 thru F6
why some people suggest me to compress a folder with tar.gz (tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /var/www) insted using gzip /var/www so it return www.gz  ??
ToddEDM2: keep the faith...everything is set...if it doesn't work it is a missing checkmark or some such...a very minor thing
what is the benefit using .tar insted gz ?
didnt work ... i will try again later
I think .tar is just an archive, no compression.
ToddEDM2: truly! I can't imagine why. Sorry
.tar.gz is compressed... I think that's how it works.
is missing/broken gnome applets a common issue when dist-upgrading to gutsy?
ToddEDM2: I am looking at mine as we work on this...it is set up just like mine
.
I have a few .vcd's.. I know I looked up in the past of how to make these into iso's... I forget =\ anyone know?
Viper,  so why not we just use .gz than .tar.gz  ?
so there is no way I can change its hidden status without using windows?
ToddEDM2: and it works...sort of <smile>
blkthndr: perhaps linux would be able to read AMIGA floppy disks as well? Nope. aint gonna happen.
ToddEDM2: spnye@yahoo.com if you want to follow up on this and other stuff
user_ gz is just compression, for a single file, tar binds several files together
ToddEDM2: tell wifey you worked REAL hard
I have a few .vcd's.. I know I looked up in the past of how to make these into iso's... I forget =\ anyone know?
user_ i think you use them both to create an archive
=== monkey_ is now known as monTree
slightly different problem but none-the-less... it aint gonna happen.
user_ but you should use the command I have you for /home
danbhfive, so can not to gzip /var/www   is that what you mean?
danbhfive, so i must tar it first
user_ i think thats the case
danbhfive, then compress it, example use gz
hi all! which download manager is best for Ubuntu?
danbhfive, ok thanks
user_ tar can gzip it for you, just add a z directive, i believe
qwerty: I use firefox's built-in one, or flashget...
Viper: does flashget support resume?
qwerty: yup, as long as the server does.
is missing/broken gnome applets a common issue when dist-upgrading to gutsy?
blkthndr: try googling it.
user_: tar -xzf /path/to/directory/to/compress
why hasnt everyone just switched to *bsd yet?
:P
any ideas y update manager cant fetch any repositories. eveything comes back with a 404 error. I have a good network connection.
yes.. thanks
tar -z tells the tar application to use a foreign compression app.
dude: huh?
Chronosphear, i have broken applets for a similar upgrade
Viper, x is for extract
Viper: thanks
some work, most don't?
oh... same diff... lol   tar -cz then
Viper, i think it should tar czvf
i've tried googling with no help for a couple days, as well as trying the support forums and irc of rockbox
Viper,  yes.. or the simple one is cz
dude: I can think of 12 reasons right now, and I could probably think of more.
I rarely find myself compressing files, decompressing is much more common for me...
Chronosphear did you use the update manager? or did you use the cli?
update manager and then the cli because update manager only did half tho job
the*
heh, that sucks
Has anyone experience with an add-on PCI SATA raid card in Ubuntu?>
danbhfive, yeah, i rebooted thinking it was sorted and logged into a bash prompt with no window manager
in the past, cli doesn't fully work, i don't think
yes Viper
20 reasons not to switch to BSD:
you have to re-run the upgrade commands several times
=== CGI074 is now known as r3wt1nth3b0x
1) you like Windows or linux.
danbhfive, i'll give that a go then
rwrandomnessb0x: Any luck, and if so, which make/model?
2) you play games that were made for Windows.
3) BSD is hard to install
danbhfive, ah nah, it's convinced there's nothing to do now
Viper, it was a adaptec i think.
Works great.
Chronosphear i can give you some suggestions, to check it
danbhfive, sure
sudo apt-get install -f
are the repos down?
does anyone know how to edit the hotkeys for compiz effects?
ztomic: there's been some progress in porting Wine to FreeBSD me thinks
ztomic: and really it depends on your OS taste
r3w: And you didn't have any issues with MDADM?
4) Wine is pain in the arse
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
danbhfive, 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
ztomic: ditto for Wine on Linux :P
hrmm
that is probably it
@ztomic: wine is about the best linux has for playing win32 games/apps :(
when i got the bash window and no wm i just installed metacity and gnome
carrot is not a spelling mistake
danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk, now when I go to finish it says no /root found
No Viper...
does anyone know the hotkey for scale?
oh, meta package
5) You work with Windows at work and don't care about BSD.
vee_ did you set one of the partitions to /  ?
Viper why would you be using MDADM with hardware RAID?
no, its a directive actually, i think
hi
bsd is hard to install?
uhh
i think opera is great
I have a data disk that is in VCD format. How can I change this to an ISO format so I can burn it into a CD?
The following packages have unmet dependencies.  firefox: Conflicts: libnss3 but 2:1.firefox2.0.0.10+1nobinonly-0ubuntu1 is to be installed E: Broken packages
None of the other sata cards' RAID has been detected by linux...
can't see it being that tho
6) You have tried BSD in the past and you don't want to make that mistake again. But you tried OpenBSD just to be sure.
Viper brb
try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
nothing to do
danbhfive shoudl one be logical and one be primary?
are the gutsy repos down?
Ubuntu 7.10 causes my iMac G3 to restart very early in the boot process (3 seconds after yaboot). Passing "video=ofonly" kernel param didn't work, but the latest debian boots with no problem. Any ideas?
vee_ nah
vee_ thats only if you are breaking up the harddrives into several partitions
I have a data disk that is in VCD format. How can I change this to an ISO format so I can burn it into a CD?
danbhfive im clearing them again (thanx for baring with me)
if its was for microsft i wuld have used NERO burner
7) you heard Unix is different than LInux and you wanted to try a REAL OS but you were not smart enough.
Can anybody help me, I am trying to use this computer as a hub to connect my other computers to the internet
okay Viper, what card are you using?
can K3B handle VCD's?
so amarok works as root but doesn't work u sing my normal account
what might cause this
Chronosphear how about sudo apt-get autoremove
permissions Impiety
hrm
danbhfive both say FREE SPACE under them, now what
all of the libs look good
permissionwise
r00t: I'm not sure off the top of my head, it was a cheapy pseude-raid controller...
vee_  wait, did you informat them?
Should Alsa automatically pickup Realtek onboard sound devices?
you mean autoclean?
autoremove
did nothing
danbhfive i clciked manual under the partitioning menu
8) you heard that windows applications can run on it but when you tried to get help, none was available so you ditched it.
=== _vector_ is now known as _vector_afk
ok, i would use synaptic then, and resolve those broken dependencies
9) never heard of it.
danbhfive then i hit <enter> with each drive selected
uninstall any package that doesnt have a valid source
Viper i need the model to find the correct module to load.
10) it's great but how do I...?
vee_ are the drives formatted at this point?
danbhfive it then asked me whether or not to create new empty partition table
mp3melayu
how do i get a list of packages that don't have a valid source?
11) I work in Windows.
danbhfive i said yes to both
If i get the error "Could not initialize graphics system.  Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with direct draw"  Whwat should I be looking at?
danbhfive dioes that mena they are formatted?
ztomic: do you like spamming?
r00t: One sec, I'll get the model#
vee_ i dont know
vee_ its graphical isnt it?  if it says "free space" then its not formated
ok Viper
kitche: proving a point... 12) I like to prove my point.
Chronosphear look under Installed (local or obsolete)
get rid of those, unless its something that you personally put there
danbhfive, ah, thanks
is it even possible to connect two computers in ubuntu via ad hoc?
r00t: Syba SD-SATA-4P    PCI Sata Controller
I do apt-get update and every repo is said to be not available, giving a 404 error, but I can ping the ip address that apt-get is trying to pull from. whats wrong?
hey
WorkingOnWise, 404 is file not found
vee_ you lost me at some point
Hi! when I try to install kdm-kde4, I got this message: "E: kdm-kde4: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1", whats wrong and how do I solve it
WorkingOnWise, try a different repo
danbhfive, no, I'm still here.
vee_ you should format the drive, AND set the mount point
danbhfive if I select a dirve then hit <enter> I see a menu for Create a new Partition, Auto part. the free space, or Show Cylinder/head/Sector Info
danbhfive does that sound familiar?
i'm having a bit of trouble with my sata drive. it decides to shut-off for no reason after i do high amounts of i/o (aka bittorrent) on the drive
is it all freespace right now?
yes
r00t, I don't think you'll have any luck finding out why I didn't have any luck with the card, posts on newegg say it doesn't like Ubuntu...
both drives
vee_ ok, yes, click create a new drive button, where ever that is
Chronosphear: i get that error for every repo..ann 112 of them
vee_ then select ext3, and then look for a place to set the mount point
vee_ set the mount point to /
WorkingOnWise, are you set to use a proxy?
13) I got my point across and now I'de like to list 20 reasons that DOS is better than Windows.
danbhfive ok but first i have to select logical or primary to get to that menu
danbhfive which one?
primary
I'm getting a CPU overload and big networking problems. Can anybody help?
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3865216#post3865216
14.. 15 16 17 18 19 20... ok
logical is if you are creating more than 4 partitions, and you are only making one
Chronosphear: no. the only change I am aware of is last night I manually deleted the apt cache.

danbhfive  ok
scguy318, nice. too bad i have no ps3 lol

I just installed Chimera on kubuntu and don't know how to run it..
does anyone know the command?
hrmm that's weird
Viper so this is just a SATA PCI card... not a hardware raid card?
danbhfive  what should I set the second drive to  logical or primary? then i can get to the menu to set the other options
or just leave it as free space
Chronospear well, I dont know about the applets, but you still dont yet have a full ubuntu install

now, lets get my audio wokring
r00t: That card had pseudo-raid.... it said it didn't, but you get raid once you boot it up....
Has anyone here tried using Openmosix with Gutsy?
danbhfive, do what? manually uninstall?
install the libnss?
autoremove does nothing
danbhfive  /can/this/be/like/this
did you remove all the local packages?
cyntek, can't do pm because not registered
viper that card does not have raid, its a SATA card...
oh right ok
LINUX is giving you SOFTWARE raid.
danbhfive  or must i start off /home/something/else
did anybody try the last ati catalyst driver under ubuntu gutsy?
No, the card is trying to emulate raid!
sorry for my english.
vee_ it can, heh, but dont confuse yourself
It even has a RAID bios installed......
vee_ it should be under /media
Viper on boot, does the card have any kind of menu you can go in?
ooook
yup
I am running CompizConfig on Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon... I am using the Cube option for my wokspaces, how do I make more workspaces?
hmm
it's uninstalling gnome
Has anyone been able to get logitech orbit cam working in ubuntu?
grazz: I tried the restricted driver on 9550 and it sucked.
danbhfive ok media/myStuff
The box doesn't say a bit of thing about raid, nor does the site, nor does anything else... but the damn thing had it... :(
Ok, I've got a question, that I need answered. My audio isn't working. I've tried just about everything, me and cyntek has, someone help, please and thanks.
scguy318: didnt work
okay Viper, what kind of array are you trying to create?
Trevor_0017,  double click on the volume item
danbhfive doesnt give me media in the list so i entered it manually
vee_ /home is good for reinstalling linux, but that can come when you are more familiar with this stuff
kk, it's loading
vee_ thats fine
raid-1
danbhfive kewl
Just looking for redundancy on 2 drives.
danbhfive thanx for the patience
it shouldn't have to load... but w.e..... make sure non of those items are muted
RAID1 then.
np
anyone know of the boot option for ubuntu to have it not check floppy drives? i'm setting up a persistent install of ubuntu on a USB drive and it works fine on this computer but i get a bunch of fd0 i/o errors on a computer without a floppy drive
and turn the volume all the way up on all of them
So you're building the RAID1 VIA teh BIOS on the card?
this sucks
ztomic, yeah, im having a lot of problems too
How can I use more resolutions with my monitor? I tried changing the type but that ended up screwing it up. I've tried this monitor with a seperate computer and know I can get much larger resolutions, and the g card supports up to 2048 x 1536. Right now the highest is 1024x768 (ugh). Anyone have any clue what's wrong here?
i cant see the damn screen while it boots.. and it takes longer cause of that
Chronosphear, can I pm you?

<unconvertable> Slart I get google to send me any news on ubuntu or linux....and it was in a link from their digest that I read about this client.  But none that you mention ring a bell.  I know it worked with a wide variety of webcams and was strictly video no texting
hi, i'm using ubuntu studio 8.04, audacious 1.5.0, when song is over next not playing only stay in 00:00. Option ctrl+M (stop after current) is off. :/
Dante123: sounds nice..let me know if you remember the name
ikonia: do i need to make the tftp root more accessible?
Does ubuntu have a problem with me deleting the last gnome-panel?
I mean how can I have a completely panel-less desktop?
ubuntu-baby, download nvidia via envyng - once downloaded - download nvidia-settings , config your display from nvidia-settings and save to x-configuration file, dont merge save
jimmy51: certainly looks that way
hi all
ubuntu-baby, i don't know was it nvidia-glx
ikonia: ok, can you walk me through that?  i guess read only would be ok, since it's just supposed to serve up pxe images
well, ndiswrapper for me was a bit shaky on two of my wireless cards.
I got disconnected.
jimmy51: as long as it's world readable
is there a way to downgrade from backported versions to the normal stable versions?
rambo 3 - I tried Nvidia-glx Nvidia-glx-new and the other one....all 3
lesshaste_: yes.
only thing i had to do after i used this.. https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html.. was turn down my hue and it worked perfect
lesshaste Turn off the backports in synaptic and say reload, upgrade all?
Gnea, how do you do that?
Gnea, I'd like to do it for all packages
lesshaste_: try sdakak's suggestion
Can anyone tell me how to have a completely panel-less desktop?
ikonia, i think the tftproot is /var/lib/tftpboot/
jimmy51: go for it
lesshaste_: if not, you may need to uninstall the packages by hand, then reinstall them.
sdakak, it says nothing to upgrade
i cant get to medibuntu it says server not found
sdakak, how do I tell which installed packages come from backports? Maybe that would be easier
!medibuntu
medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
hi
Slart, works perfect in WinXP...
ikonia: chmod  ??  /var/lib/tftpboot
lesshaste_: ikonia would provide you better help.
TokBox is the app name Slart
lesshaste_: what's wrong with the backports?
jimmy51: 775 ?
jimmy51: Are you trying to net boot?
here is the review
jimmy51: -R
jimmy51: chmod -R
Gnea: There is a reason they are called so :)
ok
http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10008650o-2000498448b,00.htm?new_comment Check it out Slart
sdakak: huh, what's up ?
anyone else have ideas for playing dvds?
sdakak, ikonia?
sdakak: and there is a reason why they don't bother me :)
hi ikonia
hello
decline: bah.. now I don't know what to expect any more.. are they blocking connection attempts from linux computers? =)
ohyouknow1987, download vlc
Dante123: thanks.. looking at it now
ikonia, I am trying to restabilise my setup by getting rid of any backports
ohyouknow1987: i already gave you a link to help you out.
lesshaste_: ok
ikonia, do you know how to list all the installed backport packages for example?
lesshaste_: one moment, I don't think you can do it by repo
ikonia, ok
ikonia: Hey. He wants downgrade his backports
ikonia, ah, i see.  the 775 is the permission mode and the -R makes it recursive
Slart, yea hehe this is mysterious. First of all, how could it just suddenly start demanding the DNS ip's to work, and why is everything else than MSN working when I got the DNS ip's :|
Hi, any reason synaptic marks for update packages which have been pinned to a particular version?
lesshaste_: I see
jimmy51: you got it
lesshaste_: this is a bit of a longshot, but: dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep bpo   you might get mixed results.
jimmy51: you want it to be able to see the images too, not just the dir, hence the -R
decline: I have no idea.. it's very weird
I've recently wiped my old computer and gave it away, and the other hard drive on it I did not wipe had ubuntu on it.  If I just put the hard drive into my new computer, would it work?
tried amsn?
Gnea, hard to tell if that worked or not
ikonia, any help much appreciated
Joeseph, you might have to edit grub
lesshaste_: that just tives you a list. try pastebining it
!pastebin | lesshaste_
lesshaste_: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu.com (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
Dante123: bah.. silly flash app doesn't work with my ff3 =/
lesshaste_: I can't see anything within the dpkg man page that suggests it can read the repo's the package came from
Shujah_: but It might work? is the only way to try?
Gnea, http://paste.ubuntu.com/27293/
okay Slart.  I forgot it was flash based
ikonia, ok so any tips on how to remove all backports?
lesshaste_: I'm wondering if you delselect proposed which should update apt-cache policy, and do an apt-get update will it prompt you for the downgrade
lesshaste_: s/proposed/backports
ikonia, it didn't sadly
i'm having some problems installing virtual box
Joeseph, if the grub address fro hd doesnt change e.g. it was hd0 and its hd0 now then it'll boot - so you might try to boot you'll know
lesshaste_: give me a few minutes,
ikonia, unless there just weren't any.. but I suspect it only goes up that way
ikonia, ok
here is the error message: VirtualBox kernel driver not installed. The vboxdrv kernel module was either not loaded or /dev/vboxdrv was not created for some reason. Please install the virtualbox-ose-modules package for your kernel, e.g. virtualbox-ose-modules-generic..
How do I get the pidgin avant plugin to work?
can anyone help please
lesshaste_: sorry, i'm not sure :(
Gnea, ok
thanks anyway
ross: it told you what to do
ross: Are you using the os version? Why not head over to their site and grab the binary package. It builds the kernel module automatically and provides usb support.
lesshaste_: good luck
basically my sound has died so how about just reinstalling everything sound related
ross vbox has a channel.. but did you install it from our repos or go and try to get the latest and do it yourself
is that possible?
how do you reinstall packages?
ross: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox
Shujah_: Alrighty, then I'll give it a try.   but, while I'm here....  I'd like to wipe my ubuntu install also and install UbuntuStudio. since I do not have a DVD player in my computer, I can't install it that way. Could I wipe and reinstall from the command line?
errr
lesshaste_: do you have synaptic ?
ikonia, yes
ikonia, but I mostly use the command line
i installed it from the site
ikonia: ok, my permissions are read/write for root, but read only for all else.  i still can't get/put files.  either i don't have  the tftproot set to the correct folder, or something else is going on.
jimmy51: one moment
HELP!!! just did an update (system said there were updates available, went with it. Said it updated Firefox, and i needed to restart firefox, so i closed down the browser, and attempted to start it up. it gives me this "Failed to execute child process "firefox" (No such file or directory)" so i try in the terminal, and it tells me it isnt installed, so i do "sudo apt-get install firefox-3.0 (as it tells me too) and it returns: firefox-3.0 is already
the newest version....what did i do?
!find vbox
Found: isdnvbox, isdnvboxclient, isdnvboxserver, raccess4vbox3, vbox3
after sudo modprobe vboxdrv, it says "FATAL: Module vboxdrv not found."
Joeseph, you mean wipe ubuntu then install ubuntu studio? how are you gonna mount the iso - you aint got the cd-rom?
what to do what to do
lesshaste_: if you search for ubp in synaptic it shows all the backport packages, which if you then mark for re-install it will re-install from main rather than backports
 /j #perl.it
ross: it tells you to install it from the repository, not from a website
hi all. no connection to linux or ubuntu, but still: Does anyone know if I can use my phone to stream mp3 in fm so that my car radio can play whatever I want? :) I know there are such things to buy, still would be great to do it from my phone
lesshaste_: got it, get the package "apt-show-versions"
gnea: ok, i just searched for virtual box on the repos
gnea: um
Shujah_: UbuntuStudio takes a DVD. I have the iso, but I can't use it cause I have no DVD player. I could take a dvd player form one of my other systems if I had to though.
gnea: there are a lot of choices here
lesshaste_: then do apt-show-versions -i; apt-show-versions -b | grep hardy-backports
ross: and it still tells you the name of the package
gnea: which modules should i install?
Hey guys. I've added a new HDD into my machine and it is seen as /dev/sda so all my other devices got a new major device number. I have a modified fstab for mounting one partition and only this partition broke because i didn't use uuidgen. how can i get a uuid of a partition?
=== sbazemore is now known as sbazemore_
ross: read what you stated
!uuid
To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell: <unconvertable> sudo blkid <unconvertable> (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
bartmon: uuid
=== sbazemore_ is now known as sbazemore
jimmy51: sorry, you where saying
gnea: AHA
.......Please install the virtualbox-ose-modules package for your kernel, e.g. virtualbox-ose-modules-generic.........
Joeseph, well yeah you can mount the dvd by acetonel (on still installed ubuntu) but I'm not sure if it'll work
ikonia,  permissions look correct (when viewed with thunar) but i still can't GET/PUT
Jack_Sparrow, ikonia: excellent, thanks!
np
Shujah_: It might just be easier to get a dvd player....
=== sbazemore is now known as sbazemore_
jimmy51: what does your tftp config show ?
ross: cat /proc/version  will tell you what kernel you're using
Joeseph, it is, and much less likely to backfire
ikonia, that's in /etc/inetd.conf, right?
jimmy51: don't know, is that where you set it up?
gnea: ok, i'm using the 18-generic vesion
jimmy51: hang on, I'll get it myself
Joeseph, though you might wanna check the md5 before going through all the hassle
Shujah_: alright, I'll probably try that... that way I don't even have to boot it.
ross: then download the 18-generic package
anyone?
ikonia, thanks.. I feel we are very close... you didn't quite mean apt-show-versions -i; apt-show-versions -b | grep hardy-backports
did you?
Shujah_: what is the md5... wait, I'll llook it up.
gnea: only the 18-generic package?
ikonia: in my inetd.conf i have this:  tftp           dgram   udp     wait    root  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
ikonia, that lists things like autoconf/hardy uptodate 2.61-4
lesshaste_: still working it thorugh
jimmy51: ok
Is there a command line interface to burning a cdrom?  Is it as simple as dd?
ross: whatever works
Joeseph, md5 is a dvd/cd check to see if the data was corrupted during download -
jimmy51: what version of ubuntu are you using ?
ok
m-c: yes. no.
ikonia: 8.04
Shujah_: oh....  Wiki told me it was a cryptographic algorithm that is now considered unsafe.... hahaha
jimmy51: I've just pulled down tftpd and it setup the tftp root as /srv/tftp
md5 is unsafe :s
hangnails are unsafe
Gnea: Ah.  So, what program provides the command line interface to burn a cdrom?
is there an audio/video player that plays all formats and codecs in ubuntu such as vlc in windows?
ikonia, ok, maybe my config is bad.  i'll change the root to /srv/tftp
I have another question. Why is my new IDE device located at /dev/sdX and not /dev/hdX as the other IDE devices i have?
mic1394: you mean vlc for ubuntu?
m-c: cdrecord
mic1394: vlc can be installed in windows, linux, AND mac
mic1394: vlc
 jimmy51 changing it won't do anything I'm more concerned why your config is different than mine out of the box
Gnea Thank you
gnea: it's installing
is there anything better than vlc ? or do u guys suggest anthing else?
ikonia, i'm folliwng this procedure: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_pxe_install_server
Joeseph, wiki md5 sum :P
mic1394: mplayer is nice, but vlc tends to top everything these days
hmm
thanks everyone
jimmy51: that is for version 6.10
jimmy51: thats over 18 months old
Gnea Is the cdrecord application part of the ubuntu repositories?
ikonia: it's for edgy, so i've changed the package to get the hardy packages
jimmy51: yes, but more than package names change
jimmy51: hardy lays things out very differently
m-c: yes
jimmy51: for example hardy uses tcpd wrappers, edgy did not
jimmy51: you can't mix and match guides like that
Gnea Just found it, nevermind
Shujah_: that makes sense... so that's how it works... interesting.
ikonia,  is there a 8.04 guide for PXE under ubuntu?
hy there

err, its eating my pc from the inside
jimmy51: no problem
and i cant do anything
except a cold reboot
might try recompiling pidgin then.
why ?
codyzapp: why would recopiling pidgin change that ?
recompiling
s's: didn't work...still the same error...
Hmmm, I'm experiencing poor copying performance (<4MB/s) between two HDDs with UDMA6 enabled. Any ideas?
might be a bug in your pidgin. or a missing componet or file etc.
this is the second time this has happened
codyzapp: it's precompiled by ubuntu - how could it have  missing file or component
you accidently delete it? or something goes screwy.
firefox always freezes... :/
codyzapp: come on - so surly a re-install of pidgin would be more realistic than a recompile
how can I switch to some non alsa sound system to see if that will help?
Starnestommy: ty
I'd do a re-install of pidgin from the terminal  and go from there
how do i uninstall ubuntu tweak?
tweak?
DG19075: why from the terminal ?
?

yes
ikonia, you can see if any errors show up.

codyzapp: synaptic will show the same errors

how?

legend2440: tried it, didnt work...still says it isnt installed...
nixnoob: no it's not, please don't make missleadig comments
i have heard for alot of ppl that are computer geek's that linux is more secure than windows so how can linux NOT be secure?

what is a nice backup tool for ubuntu that can restore your software in case of mulfunction
??
help plz
ikonia: just compare the number of viruses for each OS, i am right.
i had 2 re4mt and update things when my system is down..
kaolaBuntuPH: file system backups are the most common way, people chose different sort of methods
ok so what kind of channel is this then if i may ask?
nixnoob: we are not discussing virus's - we where discussing security, secrutiy does not mean virus
so what software would you recommend on ubuntu
andare: an ubuntu OS support channel
dose ubuntu hase the gohst ,so i can ease recove my OS

no help..huhuhu

kaolaBuntuPH: please see the messages I sent to Kopfgeldjaeger:, they where meant for you
how can i change the port in xchat from a irc server? o.O
how can i make the performace look alot better use'n ubuntu?
Kopfgeldjaeger: sorry, those messages where not meant for you
andare: that depends on the reason it's slow, you need to diagnose why it's slow
ok but i want a backup tool that can restore my installed software also
ok
is there?
kaolaBuntuPH: then you need some sort of generic whole system image tool
how about aptoncd?
i got my computer for about $100 and it was made for windows 2000
What about PING
b

dont let windowsdream confure you
kaolaBuntuPH, aptoncd is for the purposes of installing ubuntu -- not really backing up and restoring
Hey. I want to install xfce. Currently I have Ubuntu 8.04 server install. I installed a GUI by typing [sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop] which installed the latest GNOME. To install Xfce, can I just do [sudo aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop] and then type in [sudo aptitude install xfce]? To installed Xfce?
but you can restore softwares using it right?
kaolaBuntuPH: no
kaolaBuntuPH: it makes a local repo, nothing more
so then i guess my computer is really slow cuz i don't have the $$$ to upgrade so that's why i'm try'n to learn how to tweak and overclock if it's possible for my computer to even handle it
kaolaBuntuPH, not necessarily -- it's quite possible that you upgraded packages from the online repositories and in the process pulled in other dependencies too
andare: overclocking is a bad idea
so no software installed will be reinstalled then?
andare: and is not something that is a topic in this channel
yo, i need repository help. i'm having problems with the medibuntu repository when i use update manager
then what about tweaking?
[globa|fin] there's more to removing gnome, but you can install sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop to run xfce. Just choose it under options->sessions on the login screen
ok srry
andare: how much ram do you have ?
can u gve me a specific name for the image copy thing for ubuntu?
[globa|fin] to be clear, you don't have to remove gnome to install xfce.
can sbackup do it also?

On websites

Ayabara better, you can copy it to /etc/apt/sources.list in case you want to enable it again by moving it to sources.list.d
kaolaBuntuPH, were you asking me why?
gconf-editor, apps, nautilus
used sudo while editing it on mne works fine ^^
i cant find medibuntu in my sources list :s
!ask | dolley
yep
dolley: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
!worksforme
Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should (and especially recommend to others). Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability. Please see http://geekosophical.net/random/worksforme/
Ayabara I meant, copy it to /etc/apt , not the sources.list ;)
thnx for the help j800r , it works perfectly!!!
lil-romeo: it's not a command  =).. first run gconf-editor
yes
than my friend:d

hmm
is my video chip
dolley, how about make model? :P
i'd say a linux newbie dist would be kubuntu
i have an laptop
kaolaBuntuPH, if you recommend people use sudo with X apps like that, they will develop the habit, and it's not a good habit to develop -- see !worksforme
the kde desktop is more familiar to windows users
this S3G-Linux-x86-2.0.16
<unconvertable> sHOCkwAV1: just google your wireless card, forums may help you bout it
kaolaBuntuPH it's not an opinion, there's very good reasons. Not least, the possibility of writing config's in your home directory owned by root
so how would i be able to use ubuntu aka linux without be'n a pain in someone's back side?

How do I install ndiswrapper.
Elephantma1, sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper
whats about medibuntu.org? Anybody knows?
!ndiswrapper | Elephantma1
Elephantma1: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
SeveasL I did that
I was trying to get a spanish Direction for one person
there was none

I'm not accusing anyone...
Elephantma1, and I'm not addressing you
Seveas: Thanks for saying how to install it.
<unconvertable> umadaop1: Sorry for misunderstanding.
can anyone help me? want to enable ssh and VNC after restart without an interactive login first
can anyone tell me, why medibuntu.org is down?
just install the ssh server
norman_x, give it a few hours servers go down
abadinalbany, ssh always start at boot, for vnc you'll need to do some tricks
#ubuntu-it-doc
norman_x, it will come back up
Can anyone tell me how to get wireless working with a GWAR3500 router?
norman_x, it went down briefly yesterday

=== njpatel is now known as njpatel_away
I'm having problems playing music from my DNS-323 (NAS).  I've tried playing both FLAC and MP3 on Amarok, VLC, Totem, and xine, and all four act like they're starting to play, but don't.  skipping to the next track causes each to freeze.  I've rebooted both this laptop and the DNS-323 with no fix.  Same music plays fine on the windows laptop.  Ideas?
norman_x, if you just wanna surf medibuntu for info you can try the cache in google
Sockmonkey, your router manual or support group. This is ubuntu support.
keanu, does it play when you first copy the music to a local disk?
Shujah: thanks for the hint, but I am installing a PC and need it for that
Oh, I thought I could come here because I'm trying to get it on ubuntu. And the manual offers no help. XD
Thanks anyway
keanu: hmm
how to install adobe flash player on ubuntu 6.06?
keanu, do you have the proper codec installed?
drenz, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
keanu: can you try increasing the cache?
and are you sure you have mp3 support?
umadaop1, unless something broke last night.  Everything's been working fine for months until now
seveas thanx
keanu, connection issues?
keanu: oh first question how are you connecting to the nas?
Seveas:  apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
Seveas:  dont work
is anyone else not getting to medibuntu.org ?
drenz, adding sudo might help
E: Couldn't find package flashplugin-nonfree
!flash|drenz
drenz: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (a recent version for !Dapper is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
i added sudo
poningru, both laptops are  wireless, nas isn't.
umadaop1, I'd assume restarting both would fix any connection issues
Does anyone know how to manually configure grub to dual boot with windows which resides on my second HDD?  I have gotten close; grub says starting but nothing starts
Can someone please tell me how to uninstall AlienArena?!
keanu, never assume

=== braden_ is now known as zod21
keanu, can you ping the device?
virious, two hds? ensure the windows grub entry reflects the correct hd i.e. hd0 or hd1
keanu, has the ip addresses changed on the network?
umadaop1, I can ping and connect to it fine
hi all
eh man
yo
Shujah, I tried that hd1 and the first partition
OK, definitely a problem with this laptop - copied the files onto the hard drive as Seveas suggested, and they still don't play.  totem recognizes how long the music is (and ID3 tags) but doesn't play it
Is there a way to inactivate the trashbin? So that files is deleted directly instead of moved to the trash (I know about shift+delete, but I still wants to delete directly)?
same with amarok
xintron, nautilus preferences
keanu, that could be a codec problem. Install mplayer/ffmpeg/w32codecs and try with mplayer
Try to play the music or videos with VLC I have had great success with that
hey guys

how can i compile a ubuntu package from source?
063906310628064a061f061f
hello
!source| Robzy
Robzy: You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
thanks ubottu :)
Robzy: you can always get the source on the projects site
Don't mention it
umadaop1: ty
td123: nah, I'm wanting the ubuntu source in particular
xintron, yw
with ubuntu patches and all that jazz
Robzy: ook
(cause life would be boring without openssl vulns :P)
virious, whats in grub about windows?
virious, VLC acts like it's playing (seconds played is changing) but it doesn't recognize the track length, and there's no sound.  checked vlc, alsamixer, and pulseaudio, everything's set to max (except pulseaudio, but still isn't muted)
xintron: in terminal gconf-editor then browse to     /apps/nautilus/preferences/enable_delete
legend2440, thats alot to just enable it from nautilus' check box
umadaop1: yes forgot it was in nautilus preferences

Ugg, When I try to print, I get this "%!PS-Adobe-3.0 $$Creator: (OpenOffice.org 2.4) %% For: (mxiia) %%CreationDate: (Mon..." followed by a bunch of blank pages.
MXIIA, you're using the wrong printer driver
Well, I have HP C4385, I chose C4380... 85 wasn't an option.
Robzy, if you want that permanently, just remove all symlinks to /etc/init.d/gdm from /etc/rc*.d

Robzy, dpkg-source -x filename.dsc

you need the dpkg-dev package for that
bah, shouldve known :P

Yeah.
Err, no.
They're on different HDs.
Oswy: ubuntu can only handle one version at the same time. you must edit your menu.lst by hand
if vbox 1.6 is not in the repo(synaptic) is there a site that i can get the ubuntu version (of 1.6)
the edgy menu.lst that is
wols_: How do I do that?
ie, where is the file?
by editing it. reading grub docs for starters. /boot/grub/menu.lst
After an update I lost gnome in my  hardy machine. All I get is text based login. What should I do?
the edgy menu.lst. NOT the hardy one
OK, thanks, I'll try that.

i installed it from source, ran into so difficulties and now need help uninstalling it
so i can do it from apt-get
seveas, what should i repeat?
ive tried removing everything
kafitz: if you still have a source do ''make uninstall''
carib909, you should *stop* repeating your question every minute
kafitz: ask who gave you the source how to unisntall. or read the docs. there is no standard way of uninstalling self compiled source. that's a big reason we discourage it
sree, check this out > http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html  -- might help
wols_: already am witch Live Cd at moment

(next time use aptitude to install it in the first place)
kafitz: you can look at the files in the install target and remove them by hand.
wols_: do i need to delete the partition and then resize it ?
(next time use aptitude to install it in the files in the first place)
ok, i will try that then
wols_: data
redduck676: that would mean he understands waht a makefile means
yeah, i will
d0t: why?
wols_: dev/sda3: data
netcatc: seems you hosed your sda3
netcatc: file -s
wols_: so how can i resize it ?
Reformer81, as far as I know only way to do that would be to increase the unhide time of bottom panel 10 times and use awn on top of it
d0t: you can etierh delte it and recreate it at the new size or use gparted
kafitz: you can look at the files in the install target and remove them by hand.
Shujah-1: Hmm... I guess that is doable.
yeah, i will try that would be to increase the new size or use awn on top of it
Thank you
baconnessie: /dev/sda3 data
sorry for being naive, but how do i find the install target?
wols_: so how can i guess that is doable.

hi all. How do you get rid of firefox3.0 beta 5. no matter what I do, thats what I get when I install firefox from official hardy repository
is there a gnome-panel-applet around that shows BOTH cpu temperature and frequency with the possiblity to alter the frequency like cpufreq-selector does?
xkcd pws!
Seveas: better than telling why it's doing that for real ;-)
Reformer81, didnt work?
I'd like to download the source for commands "ls" and "cd". How can I do that. Thankyou.
err that doesnt show both but lets one choose the frequency from it :-)
threedee, apt-get source coreutils
Seveas, direct rendering: Yes, that means I got it installed... thanks
Malix: do you have the updates repository enabled?
Seveas: Thankyou very much
Shujah-1: Oh, not that.  I haven't tried it yet :)  I'm sure it will work, though.

why does devede take so damn long i have 4gb ram a 3.2 dual core pent 4 and it takes hours whats the deal is there anything faster ?

is there another ubuntu server or channell?

asked this earlier but had to leave - yesterday I was able to play music fine in amarok (it's all I've been using) and was able to play files locally and from my NAS.  Today, I can't play any mp3 or flac (don't have any others to test) in Amarok, VLC, totem, mplayer, or xine.  any ideas on how to fix it?

IdleOne: Finished?
wols_: thanks for incentive
gnomefreak: whats 'proposed' in kubuntu terms
wraund, nope.  it acts like it's about to play, and just sits there doing nothing.  skipping to the next track (which also doesn't work) in most of the above programs causes them to freeze
ahh..
close it all down
Malix: proposed is a repo that is used to push packages to before they go into update (im fairly sure its updates)
then open a terminal, and run 'killall amarokapp' without quotes
then type amarok
and press enter
does anyone have an audio setup that "just works", i.e. all applications can use the sound card without interference or crashing simultaneously? and if so, how was it achieved?
see if errors are displayed there :)
quick question:  assume i've installed this on a small fraction of my drive and now decide i like it - can i expand it to get rid of windows completely, or do i have to reinstall?
gnomefreak: but I have all those enabled o_O

wraund, I've restarted both the NAS and laptop several times with no luck.

wraund, ok

ok

look under engine
gnomefreak: yes, but isn't 3.0 final already there?
what is it using
Malix: but it will your repos in a week or so
Malix: final is in -updates
Shujah-1: Well, this will work for now.  But I'm curious... isn't there someway to modify the panel's configuration file on the fly?  For example, set a "visible" attribute to zero?
atleast I have it on _this_ computer, but on the other it reverted to b5 o_O
wraund, xine
im having a problem with cron not working is there somthing special i need to do to get cron to work
Malix: 3.0.1 is newer than final
gnomefreak: well, obviously, but isn't there 3.0 final in the normal repositories?
no?
keanu: and what is the output plugin shown as?
Malix: apt-cache policy   for ffox3?
Shujah-1: hm, okay, trying that
Malix: than you need to update it becasue only one not updated to final is in gutsy and im working on that sort of
Malix: -updates, not the main ones

Malix: yes its in -updates repo
No sound, cannot find card! how to fix?
Malix: not in gutsy only hardy
Reformer81, you can probably make a script for it, place it on the desktop - But I gather that would be too much hassle for something like that

its not in /etc/X11

fake51 its adware tracking cookie hidden that is not removed by the cleaner firefox
Where is a good place to ask a question about encrypted partitions not booting?  In particular, /dev/disk/by-uuid seems to be missing.
gos, a cookie is a browser thing
i used setfont on one of my virtual (ctrl+alt+f4) terminals to change the font, and now my typing is getting randomly replaced by underscores -- the actual letter typed is the same, but it displays on the screen as an underscore. any idea how to fix this, or reset things?
storm_zen, I think you just asked in a good place. If anyone knows the answer they will speak up Im sure.
quilby: xorg.conf has been optional for a few releases now.  Maverick questions belong in #ubuntu+1 though.
pici: ok thanks

Last night I used PGP full disk encryption to encrypt the disk from inside a Windows partition.  ( As the software is meant to do. ) ... the problem is that now I can't boot into my usual encrypted Lucid environment.  I'm not sure how to fix this.  Grub2 is complaining and listing a UUID ( I can't see what the entire error message is because it is going off the screen. )  .. how do I fix this?
gos, go to ubuntu-offtopic  bazhang is there to talk to you
storm_zen, I saw ur post earlier, is this a widows ap, or linux app that did the PGP encrypt?
or in other words, how did you encrypt this partition.
PGP Desktop, a Windows program.
KE1HA: ... but not a partition encryption... a full disk encryption..
storm_zen, ok, and you encrypted the partition Post UB installation ?
I encrypted the disk post encrypted Ubuntu installation.
howdy
storm_zen, I need to think on that one fer a bit, but I dont think you'll get through the encryption layer with a bootloader, but could be wrong.
KE1HA: Would such a thing change the UUID of the partition?  That seems to be my issue.
KE1HA: I had Karmic running successfully Linux encrypted partition + PGP Desktop full disk encryption on top of it.

storm_zen, I'm not familiar with the app your referring too, I've not used it, nor can I see a reason for it, but that's here nor there. Can you use this windows app to remove this encryption ?
KE1HA: In theory, yes.  But that's not my first choice:  It's a 10 hour commitment to do so.

arvind_k, thx, but i need make share on windows, not linux
as said, I'm new to Linux & ubuntu. Infact, this is for the first time i'm using ubuntu..:-s
Nikie, cant help. its linux. if you help yourself then only others will be able to help you.

ah okay scampbell
oops ! homework ?
bazhang: Ya...whenever i open the browser i have to enter the username and password... IS there any way that i could update through the terminal...
babigeneric: make your bind server a slave to ms server, tell ms server your linux server is allowed zone transfers.  Bring up bind and query and name.  Bind will bring copies of the dns over, change the domain in bind from slave to master.  You're done.
I've gone through the ubuntu forums..n posted a few threads..n entered here to seek some guidance..
Sangeeth, I'd say no. try to contact your school network admin

shayaknyc: Well, you have the server and the client side. What is the error message on the client when you try to connect. What does the logfiles say on the server after you tried to connect.
Frater: checking now
thanks scampbell thats what i was wondering if it is at all possible to do that so all i need is to change the line in the zone file from slave to master
I just would like to you to understand the problem i've encountered, n help if you had already come across this scenario before..
BlaDe^:  apt-cache search gstreamer | grep dev   shows me libgstreamer0.10-dev
That's all !
scampbell:  I have that already
babigeneric: yep, once you got the copy it's yours.
once the zone has been updated

running lucid. this morning, the screen was black, and I couldn't get a response. It's running in vbox, so after about 45 minutes, I just shut it down. It turns out that it was doing a full backup, because I had forgotten to mount the network drive where the backups are kept, so it was treating the mount point as a local directory, found no interim backups, and so began a full. Is there some...
...way to get a response when something like that is going on, a linux version of ctl-alt-del?
i am getting locale error how to fix that LANGUAGE UNSET ; LOCAL ALL UNSET error
frater: my iptables are configged properly (i believe) and pptpd is running :(
Hey :)
I need some help here, can I get any support here
? :)
ask the question, not if you can ask a question
j_ayen_green: trick for the future.  Remove all permissions on the mountpoints (when they aren't mounted).  chmod a-rwx /mountpoint.   When mounted it will have whatever permissions the media wants, when not it's untouchable so that sort thing stands right up instead of hosing all your disk space.
eh what is the best distro on the earth and.. on the moon?
`oi: seriously.
`oi: If you're expecting any other answer than Ubuntu, then you should be asking in ##linux, not here.

Hi all my Ubuntu machine fully updated is not showing the plymouth :( and sometimes it shows for just a split second. any workaround??
j_ayen_green: my guess is that you ran out of disk space for crucial needs, it's very difficult for me to guess the exact situation.  My flailing attempt would be ctrl-alt-f1 for a text screen and see if I can unfsck things from there.
In dockbarx nautilus doesn't show up :) how can I make it show up, nautilus shows up in default window list, what do I Need to do to make it show up in dockbarx?

scampbell: no, wasn't out of disk space...I'm only using about 10 gig out of 50. I was watching the process monitor in windows (the host) while this was going on, and it was a lot of disk action, the occasional network action (reading a different networked drive that it includes in the backup) and about 80% cpu...so it was active, it was a matter of the screen saver wouldn't respond and clear

j_ayen_green: Don't know, the evidence given was that a backup process was writing to the wrong place and your system became unresponsive.  I've seen the  screen saver and X in general lock up hard for disk space issues before. If that's not the case for you then we are just playing darwinian pool :)
bazhang, any idea?
luka, I'd suggest trying with those first
er, darwinian pool:  You are given a pool table with the balls in the pockets you must tell us how they got there .
 usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed
bazhang, ok I installed it but dunno how to set it
:)
how can i solve this&
please help
luka, right click add to panel and adjust there
j_ayen_green: I can say that in the specific case of the locked screensaved it's goign to be extremely difficult to get around that if it's failed.  It's designed just for that.  Personally, I don't allow screen saver or screen locks to happen on my servers as a matter of safety.
scampbell: well, it's that it was backing up what is 20% of the total disk space available, so I don't know how that could have filled it.  I shut down the host, rebooted, and then received a fail message on the mount, because the mount point now had files in it, a good share of the full backup, and the deja dup gave me a popup saying the backup had failed for unknown reasons. I presume...
...based on the activity that it was still cruising along doing the backup, and that had the system pegged

How do I force download of a package if the package is already up to date?
hareldvd, what package and why ?
hareldvd: aptitude download package_name; will download it to the current directory if that is what you want
scampbell: I've noticed in the past that the photo slide show screen saver sometimes just sits there black, and that it's sometimes slow to respond to a mouse click, to clear itself. I wonder if the system being pegged like that and the screen saver having (presumably) a very low priority was a fatal situation
j_ayen_green: that's one form a resource exhaustion.  Perhaps a message queue got stuffed by the backup software trying to complain about the situation, I could make up others but they're all without evidence :(

carandraug: I don't think the #ubuntu channel can tell you much about that. Perhaps ask in a firefox channel about such programming.
nilsa5: I've installed gufw.  Is that the one you mentioned?
scampbell: could be. I'm of the opinion for some reason that the backup software was having no problem, since it had already created numerous full backup volumes and had plenty of disk space left, but that I just couldn't get to the desktop because of the screen saver being in the way
stercor: yes
#ubuntu GUYS I NEED HELP FOR REDIRECTING SOUND OUTPUT TO LINE IN JACK(BLUE ONE) BECAUSE LINE OUT JACK(GREEN ONE) IS DEAD!
scampbell, thanks. I asked ubuntu-app-devel but got no answer there. I'm so used to look only into the ubuntu community that it never ocurred me to ask firefox

tought firestarter is not that good option after what i mean-_-
anyone? I asked in lowercase o.O that's important
yo luka stand in line/?/
xD
luka: line in is for input, line out and speaker out would be for output.  Both line out and speaker out are likely outputting by default, however, line out is a signifcantly lower voltage.  You might try alsamixer to ensure the individual volumes are turned up but line out and speaker out or not interchangable electronically.
lol@stand in line
scampbell, with windows I managed that with realtek hd audio manager
is there an easy way to switch between network interface settigns?
nooow that is answer,could some pretty pretty please with cherry on top give a little lost guy like me a little help maybe?
xD
scampbell: so what's ctl-alt-f1 do? I just did it, to try, and the screen went blank and asked for a login, which I gave, and now it's just sitting there
luka: then try alsamixer, if the voltage is sufficient for your need fine, just wanted you to be aware of the electronic issue there.
!ask | dmaxx
dmaxx: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-)
dmaxx: If you have a disk image perhaps you can mount it on another system.  I don't use ghost so I don't know what it put on the backup disk really.
scampbell: ah, now I appear to be at the command ine
i know that without u  blue gonna tell the bot 2 tell me xD

except testdisk???
j_ayen_green: ctrl_alt_f1 switches you to the text screen, no gui at all.  ctrl-alt-f7 (or 8 depending on your installation) will take you back to the graphical.
scampbell, i did but only notebook speakers work...
I am desperate, and searching for someone who can help me with permissions in ubuntu, (ProFTPD and Samba)
scampbell: ah! thanks :)
j_ayen_green: be aware that a locked screen saver will disallow that action so you can't get out of it that way. another reason why I think screensavers are bad.
Oer, thaks man you made my day

xangua, did that too... the instructions are pretty clear, and I have used this feature before... but for some reason, in a new installation where plugins-extra was not installed until an hour ago this feature is not working
yanick_, of your 3.9gb used, 3.7 is used by the os to cache files. This is good.
Anyone know good wallpaper for Ambiance theme?
vigo: Mmm...ok...I'll have a look. Should an error situation result in some log entries?
What command does Nautilus use to mount drives without root privs?
do someone know a better software then testdisk 2 use 2 recover a formatted/wiped HDD??
bazhang - http://paste.ubuntu.com/479464/
misha: That is the next step to look into, yes.
Seveas-train, oh yeah? my system is lagging as hell as soon as my hd starts spinning and writing like crazy for 30 seconds every 5 min and the mouse stops moving, etc.
this is GOOD?
yanick_, the moment an application needs the memory, those files are removed from the cache.
yanick_, this is not the reason of your disk spinning like hell. That is something else
Which logfile would be closest? As I said, syslog just ends without any mention of any problems...
Seveas-train, the biggest app open are Chrome and Netbeans... how can they use 4GB of RAM??
dmaxx, a magnifying glass
Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN Nikie and ifconfig shows wlan0
remote????? whoot??
yanick_, they are not. Most of your memory is actually unused, so linux uses it to cache recently used files this makes your system considerably faster. Try to find out what is running during your periods of lag and what it is doing.
Nikie, you have an unencrypted wifi spot to test on?
is that really a software??? >_<
Seveas-train, the system is fine until it goes in screen saver mode (screen locked), then everything starts to get sticky, slow and laggish
dmaxx, i admire your originality
misha: Network Interfaces, should be
:-p
yanick_, that looks more like you have enabled opengl screensavers while using an intel or old videocard
vigo: I had a quick peek at ifup/dn but can't immediately figure out how they would detect a complete system crash...
Seveas-train, my video card is an ATI Radeo HD 3670
Is it possible to delete your swap partition and add it to your main one? I have 4GB of RAM and haven't used swap in a LONG time. I don't think so anyways. I long ago set my swapiness to 0.
hello
yanick_, or some screensaver that insists on loading gigs of photos
Seveas-train, my system is a Dell Studio XPS 16 , so I'd say pretty recent hardware, there shouldn't be any lag....
how to set the login windows backgroud in ubuntu 10.04
bazhang - No :(
misha: I only suggested those as an alternative to a system boot, and those sys calls may help find the error.
Seveas-train, yeah... that should be more like it, even though all I see for pictures are the gnome color test one all the time :/
how can I reduce resolution of wallpaper from 1920x1600 to 1024x768 without losing picture capacity
are = is
yanick_, just use 'blank screen' as screensaver. You're not looking at it anyway :)
Friar: I would not recommend removing the swap partition (although is possible). Are you having problems of space on the disk?
anyone can help me ?
vigo: OK. Well, the problem is that I can't do *anything* with the computer. The mouse and keyboard is dead, it just lacks responding :(
OpenSourceCode:  use gimp

I know ubuntu has the UbuntuOne store but it really doesn't have any artists I like in it. I'd love to actually buy music but I can't see how I can do this on linux. Is there any way I can buy itunes music on linux/ubuntu?
candrea, I have a 30GB SSD, so I'm kind of tight....also, I don't know if I have anything in a recycle bin. My wife kept putting pictures on the SSD when I told her to used the external HDD for that becasue we simply do not have the storage space. We take a lot of pictures.
cole_, https://launchpad.net/gdm2setup
oh no,my version is 10.04
Seveas-train, aawww... but they are nice looking and makes Ubuntu look cool :P yeah. I'll try to use the blank screen only and see if the problem persists. However, I think it is a -1 for Ubuntu; the fact that it get's laggy with OpenGL screensavers...
Nikie, that is what unencrypted means
there is no gdm2setup
cole_, i gave you the link
yanick_, did you install the closed source driver for your ati card?
ojii, check the appdb and join #winehq
Seveas-train, yes
!appdb | ojii
ojii: The Wine Application DB is a database of applications and help for !Windows programs that run under !WINE: http://appdb.winehq.org - Join #winehq for application help
Seveas-train, I activated the thrid party repos and insalled it
bazhang, I'm aware of wine, but that's not what I call a solution
yanick_, err, it's not in a 3rd party repo...
Seveas-train, or do you mean did I download it from the ATI site ?
Nikie, once that is done, then sudo dhclient wlan0 to test
yanick_, no, from the 'restricted' repo
Do you foresee issues with using debs in lucid, but werent created for karmic? Was going to use this ppa for the dcc-client, etc. http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonasped/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/d/dcc/
Seveas-train, then yes, sorry I meant restricted
ojii, that or use virtualbox with windows, there is not a linux version of iTunes, nor will there ever be
hello all

Friar: to remove the swap you'll have to both delete the partition and remove the reference from /etc/fstab
n ping u back...
quick question does anybody else find 8.04.4 more stable than 10.04
bazhang, :(
8.04? :-o   nooooo
MACscr, could work, but completely at your own risk and unsupported when/if it breaks
why i'm asking is i'm thinking of going back
to 8.04.4
candrea, will deleting the partition allow me to have the extra 2GB of space?
CopyWriter: 8.04 is more tested and fixed then 10.04 because its older and still supported
or should i just stick to 10.04
CopyWriter: 8.04.4 will have more testing and bug sqaushing done.
Friar: yes, but first you'll have to resize your "main" partition too
could someone explain what RSA keypair is all about?
=== histo_ is now known as histo
ajsie, Google RSA

!google | yacc
yacc: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
i love the 10.04 lts release but it's a paiin to configure my wireless drivers
yanick_, that was for you ^^^^
ajsie, or look on wikipedia for "public key cryptography"
propriety hardware driver doesn't detect it
abhijit, good to know
Friar: to modify partitions you'll have to use a live cd
ajsie: its a form of asymetric key encryption. Its a rather indepth topic, so you should google it.
but in your opinions guys which would you choose the 8.04 lts or 10.03
i mean 10.04
Candrea. Thanks for the help. I'm not sure I want to risk it at the moment. I have heard that people can sometimes have problems changing partitions...like losing everything.
!poll | CopyWriter
CopyWriter: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
CopyWriter, dont poll here
sorry about that guys
ajsle: They are for Authentication
did it without even realizing
=== _ng is now known as _NG
bazhang: think it might be better just to get the packages from the developers and compile it?
didn't mean to offend anyone
MACscr, certainly safer
CopyWriter: whats the point of asking?, neither maintain your own ubuntu :)
Friar: to try to save more disk space have you tried using the Disk Usage Analyzer?
ajsie, basically, RSA is an encryption algorithm that uses a private key to encrypt data and use a public key to be able to decrypt it
[17:05]  * CopyWriter scratches his head, trying to figure out how to ask bestbot
candrea, I have not. what is that/
yanick_: i think u got it wrong
yanick_: public key to encrypt and private to decrypt

Hi! Can I install Ubuntu 32bit on the notebook with the i3-330M processor ( http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=47663 ) ?
yes figured iti out

yanick_: ive got 2 files: id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
Does anyone here have any experience with the nvidia-drivers. I'm suspecting those for causing my system to hang...
lukaszg, sure
so the first one is private and the second one is public?

yes

 Heya!  Kubuntu:10.04 ---> KDE , NDvIDIA 7200gs, 2 acer 25 inch monitors... Everytime I restart kde I lose multimonitor config.  I have read forums and tried most fixes. Please advise! :)
Friar: you can safely remove old kernels (if you are sure that the new one works OK), but it won't save much space
lukaszg: amd64 has nothing to do with amd cpus, its also for intel cpus
hi, I've just upgraded from karmic to lucid lynx on an asus a6000KM laptop. I've managed to get the wifi up, and seemingly everything works fine. I just can't reboot if I stop the system.

hello, I want to find out an IP from a computer name, I've used nslookup but it's not working since my DNS server isn't telling me the IP, how else can I do it? or do I have to setup my own DNS somewhere?
candrea, I am pretty sure...I just updated to 2.6.33 for the TRIM support. I have a file that is 1GB called bootchart. It is in /var/log and it says there are 382 items in it....
what means if when I run gparted I got the message "can't have overllaping partitions"?
misha: nvidia-current: Installed: 195.36.24-0ubuntu1~10.04
normally, the ping command will resolve an ip address from a domain name.
milko, that you're trying to make 2 partitions occupy the same space
tatofoo: fyi
anyone have any experience with a good bluetooth manager for tethering to an iphone for kde 3.x?
tatofoo: do you mean a domain name? Like get the ip for google.com?
gnomefreak: Yeah, same as me :( I'm just fumbling around in the dark with this system of mine.
=== em is now known as emma
tatofoo: you can use ping
tatofoo:  normally, the ping command will resolve an ip address from a domain name.
if I do 'ping COMPUTER01' it's telling me 'ping: unknown host COMPUTER01'
bazhang, so, do you think that ubuntu 32bit will be works fine on it?
and we are on the same network
candrea, my disk usage also says that I only have 14GB on /. So I am clearly missing something...cause my df command gives this for sda: 25540128   2424776  92%
Friar: mh, bootchart file should be an image containing some information about the boot
tatofoo: is the name you are trying to resolve from one of your own domains?
lukaszg, of course, just install the pae package I mentioned
Seveas, my problem is when I want to install ubuntu
Friar: if you don't know what bootchart is, you can safely remove this file and the 'bootchart' package
how do run adobe air apps? (adobe air 2 is installed)
tatofoo: what do you need the ip for?
bazhang, ok, thanks you very much
lukaszg, welcome
sipior: yah, I looked up in /etc/resolv.conf and they both have the same domain
tatofoo:  If you are trying to ping a system on your own network with a computer name of "computer01" you will either need a hosts entry in your /etc/hosts file or the ip address / mac address to contact the device....
New user, installing ubuntu on my notebook and I am unsure on how to partition it, 250gig. 2 gig swap, 40Mbyte boot, how big should I make root and home with the remaining 248ish Gigs?
candrea, I remember doing something about it when I first got my SSD to see the boot time. It seems like every boot has saved a file though.
Friar: can you please give me the usage of /, given by "df -h"?
Sevas_afk, with the live cd the partitions are showed with nautilus
but these are not recognized by the installer
Nasder, boot should be a bit bigger, at least 100MB, although I use 250MB
hello, stupid question but probably easy to answer - could i run a 64 bit ubuntu vm within a 32 bit ubuntu host OS?
aj00200: I want to administer remotly some computers and they have their IP dynamically assigned, changing it to static is not an option :(
[17:13]  * jwheare_local sdflj
tatofoo: Try getting DynDNS.
acarr: MAC address :O! can I specify it in /etc/hosts instead of the IP?
bazhang, I'll correct that then, should I split root and /home 50/50?
how to check what wifi drivers are loaded to my system ?
Nasder, 20-30GB for root, then the rest for a separate home partition
candrea, I may have just screwed things up....I did sudo apt-get remove bootchart....I dont know what my command line is doing now.
Friar: yes, for this reason bootchart eats a lot of space -- if you no longer need it remove both the packages and the files in /var/log/bootchart
microsoft: ?
Nasder, way too large, even if you install the entire repo
tatofoo: If they're behind a NAT, you'll need to setup port forwarding.

microsoft, could you paste.ubuntu.com the output of lspci and ifconfig please?
tatofoo: also, is the machine on the same subnet as the machine you are trying to reach it from, or, do you have a static route setup if it is not?
acarr: yes, I use it already for wake on LAN, can I get the IP from it?
I don't know why, but when I want to install ubuntu 10.4, the partitions are not recognized... but the partitiones are showed in nautillus
Hey guys, how do I find out the host address of my printer?
acarr: same subnet
candrea, too late....I removed the bootchart folder and contents and it used up the buffer on my terminal.
tatofoo: dhcp?
tatofoo: or static ips
candrea, well, here's to hoping that I can still boot next time I start my computer.
tmos: is this a network printer?
acarr: dhcp, static is not an option
Yes aj
tatofoo: what is the ip of the machine you are on?
i cant give u my ifconfig cuz there is to much private info
So it's good when set as, 200Mbyte root, 2 Gbyte swap, 20Gig Root and the rest (225ish Gig) for /home
microsoft, just tell me if it shows wlan0 or the like then
<bazhang> yes it show wlan0
milko, just try this it is not guranteed solution bu try it go to gparted from ubuntu livecd and make a partition blank on which you want to install ubuntu and then try installing it
tmos: let me see if I can find how to do this. I did something similar recently
acarr: 10.0.18.82 and the other is 10.0.18.78

<bazhang> but i can do for example modprobe rt2870sta and i know device rt2870 is no connected but the driver is loaded but how to check that this driver is loaded or get list of lodad drivers cuz for example why i type lsmod it show me connected devices and the drivers those devices use at the moment
bazhang, I reckon he pinpointed it to you as I just threw it out there.
tmos: Is this printer already setup for printer sharing with a windows network?
acarr: right now I know because I looked at it, but let's say, I shut them down and power them tomorrow (asumming there is not only one machine but 50 now) I won't know the IP of all of them, so that's why I was asking the NAME -> IP thing
Nasder, okay you saw he said about the same then
but that doesnt mean that this are all loaded drivers
there maybe more loaded but not in use
Yes it is working with Windows 7 on my other box
Any thoughts about the USB modem?
hi, I've reinstall grub using http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275 point 13. At startup it reports "Error: file not found", but it still manages to boot. How can I make sure that grub will work for sure?

Hey all, when installing openoffice I keep getting an error of "short read in buffer_copy" in an OO debian package.
ocean, oops ! thank you for the update, herez the recap...;)
toter: That's because there is no font. IIRC, it's just a custom logo
ocean, Initially when i installed ubuntu 10.04 on virtual Machine, it was able to detect the wireless network and got connected to it automatically...However, when i've installed ubuntu as a dual OS, it has detected the wireless network but is not getting connected.
I've set up an samba share, and added a directory to share. The directory also includes 2 hard drives that is running on a another computer that I've mounted. The problem is that when I try to create a folder och upload a file from my computer, I get a message "no permissions" but when I am in putty and dir into the directory, I am allowed to create a folder and so on.

I've put all permissions to 777, and I am able to create folder and so on when i am using ssh
econdudeawesome mplayer and mpg321 to name two....
xangua: package is "mpd" (is in apt-get install mpd?)
toter: the Ubuntu font is currently in beta, and only Ubuntu Members can access it, sorry
ya..true..earlier when i was using encrypted connection, it was not getting connected...he asked me to use unencrypted connection..so, i had disabled the password encryption..n u can see the dhclient connected
Nikie: ok, the output frm the dhclient command gave you an actual ip-address on wlan0. If you would do a 'ifconfig wlan0' at this point, it should show that there is an ipaddress. Can you connect to internet(sites) now?
xangua: iflema: do you recommend these over MOC in general also, or because my particular install is crapping out ;-) ?
I just dont get why I cant do it when i am using my own computer, literally speaking I am using the same user? because I log into the share with the ubuntu username and password?
bobo123, aj00200: I understand that all our time here is a donation to the community, and I respect that, but I am an active supporter of the community too
ya..without password encryption..
R\Peaceman: when you try to write over the samba mount, are you logging in? is it prompting you for username/password, or did you set the default permissions so that anyone can write to it?
candrea: it's just <unconvertable> a font... I don't understand the difficulty in trying to get it...
I don't have even time to install ssh-server or stop gdm using the console. Is there a way to start without X if there is no grub?
The system is a fresh instalation
econdudeawesome your install is not supported here ;)
toter: deal with it until it is publicly available.
econdudeawesome: well mpd has terminal and gui inferfaces
nobody has a freaking website so I can download this font?
toter: Seems odd that they would release it as a closed beta. I thought ubuntu was all about open-ness
I've tried both, to mount a windows share and put in the login information and i've tried without logging in, nothing is working
however, when i'm encrypting, I'm not able to connect..( to restrain others 2 us my network i protected with password)
Nikie: indeed. What could help (not sure if you already tried) is go to menu System > Preferences > Network Connections and remove the current wireless setup and then add it again
toter: wait until maverick relelase

I have a USB Multitech ZBA modem that doesn't get properly probed under a clean Ubuntu 10.04.  In Arch Linux, it works, and this is the output: http://codepad.org/aHa6gbH1  What should I do to get it to work?

if i want to run an iptables command every time pc starts where should i put it?
Hey, I'm in a bit of a pickle.... I was using teamviewer when it stopped responding, and now most of linux is frozen.
BrixSat /etc/rc.local
BrixSat: do you want it to run when you boot the computer, or when you log in into your account?
thanks guest__
candrea:  when i boot the pc
is it possible to insert ubuntu server in usb?
BrixSat: then rc.local is the right place (like guest__ suggested)
Synthead: ohh... I don't know much about usb-modems... haven't seen any such actually but I talked with someone in australia that tried to use some usb 3G-mobilephone-modem with win98 before... I wasn't much help there either though :-/

Here, let me elaborate, I can move the mouse, but cannot click. I can change workspaces, but can't alt-tab to other windows in a workspace. I was able to start chatzilla and join irc using the keyboard.
there is also a menu that is stuck open
Spaztic_One: does this happen every time you switch on the computer? or does it happen when you do something special?
I was using teamviewer when it stopped responding
this is the first time it has happened
Spaztic_One: I guess perhaps some application have 'stolen' your mouse and are not releasing it... what happens if you remove the mouse and insert it in the computer again after som seconds?
Its hard to remove a touchpad >.>
ah....
Might add, I am using a laptop and Ubuntu 10.04
The right ctrl key doesn't release the mouse?
Spaztic_One: is teamviewer still running?
Coincidentally, I do have a mouse hooked up and tried that, and nothing changed, probably due to the fact that the touch pad never gets disconnected
candrea: yes, sort of. Its greyed out and non-responsive, with a dropdown menu that is on every workspace
=== zobbo_ is now known as blowers
Spaztic_One: that must be the problem
Spaztic_One:  if nothing else works, you can press ctrl-alt-F1 to get a textmode console and there kill teamviewer with pkill teamviewer  or ps to find the number and kill that number
Spaztic_One: do you know how to use tty?
killall blah
(and ctrl-alt-F7 to get back to graphic screen after)
do I need to use a full blown textmode console, or can I just use the terminal?
term
Spaztic_One: if you can open the terminal, you can use it
Spaztic_One: yeah normal terminal window works fine allso
Spaztic_One: just run xkill then click on the app that you want to kill
amanita_ can't click   heh
YEah, short cut for it still works.
im running ubuntu 9.04 on my laptop and have a strange problem
how do i install python-pykickstart on my ubuntu 10.04??
i cant watch youtube/streamed videos when ive connected my TV to it
i can only watch in small screen cant use fullscreen
But no, I don't know how to use tty
any idea what to do?
ubuntu 10.04 ....
Spaztic_One: no problem: if you use a terminal, you don't need a tty
Spaztic_One: if you are in a terminal sudo apt-get install htop then run htop
need ?     hmmm      we don't need computers at all.
spaztic_one: it will help you to kill processess.
pierre_: do you know if you have the drivers for your video card installed?
yeah
regular movies works etc
and drivers are installed for everything
just youtube in full screen doesn't work pierre_?
So, I need to get htop to be able to list running processes to kill them?
ANY streamed video via browser
how to set smbd workgroup?
works on normal but not fullscreen
Spaztic_One no.    there are several ways to list processes
pierre_: is this a new installation of ubuntu?
Spaztic_One: not necessarily, you can also just use "killall teamviewer"
reggi: didnt work on my old one either
reggi: ive had the installation for 3-4 months tho
is anyone familier with how to configure amanda for 10.04?
pierre_: which browser are you using?
hi there
firefox
Spaztic_One if you know the name of an app you want to kill just run    killall <name>     or you can search for the name with things like "ps"  which is already installed
What is one that lists processes because it can't find a process called teamviewer
and ps only lists two items
pierre_: do you have chromium?
nah getting it
brb
Spaztic_One "ps ax"
pierre_: ok
Spaztic_One: ps x
how do i install python-pykickstart on my ubuntu 10.04??
Spaztic_One: or, since you can't use the mouse: ps x | less

luist apt-get install <blah>     if you have the package you can use   dpkg -i <path/to/blah>
hello folks, Im trying to solve some problems with my hard drives and usb disks - am I assuming that erasing fstab and restarting enables me to get a fresh start so to speak or will this totally break the mounting of my devices?
guest__: its not in the repos and i dont have the package
Spaztic_One heh.  you can scroll up in the terminal too...
anyone using nx?
luist then find the package and go from there.
guest__: where can i find it? any deb package is ok?
Hi.  Can someone help me? I had Ubuntu installed on my computer. I also have Windows Vista (which I hate). But today it would not let me go online. It said there was a broken link. I could not find it. I uninstalled it. I installed Download Ubuntu Desktop Edition 32 bit. And then it told me when it finished downloading to choose a program to open it up. I chose Internet Explorer. Now I can't find the
	MiketheMagiCat	program anywhere on the computer, or in my files. I also tried loading it on to my usb flash drive, and it didn't work. Is there a phone number to call for support for Linux products. I am a beginner and an idiot.
<maitrey> Hi,  I have formatted my usb and then there was the permissions problem. I have used the "chown" message in terminal, but now I can't copy anything on it from another computers. How shall I give the permissions to all the computer/users?
<maitrey> <maitrey> thanks
Spaztic_One: once you have found the pid of the process (the number in the leftmost column), type "q" to exit from less
luist where... python.org ???   any .deb ok... no.  use one that is compatable with your other packages (python)
hi all
I'm getting a bunch of errors   .: 5: Can't open /scripts/functions
candrea, can't scroll when the mouse doesn't work, or at least I don't know how to via the keyboard
when update-grub is run from packages like linux-image
luist dpkg will warn you if there are dependancy issues.   and you can take action to correct that
Spaztic_One: if you're using less, just use the arrows of the keyboard
i get the errors right after cryptsetup runs (even though I'm not using an encrypted config)
Spaztic_One page-up  button   or maybe   shift+page-up
Spaztic_One: just put |less behind the command
s/button/key/
Hey guys
it looks like its occuring right after cryptsetup adds the information to the initrd image about the resume device candidate(s)
Spaztic_One: or, just search for a pattern: ps axuw | grep team
I was talking about scrolling when not in |less
anyone willing to help me with something?
Spaztic_One me too

jacob_: just ask your question in the channel please
guest__: python.org wont give me this package :P
but either way, pkill teamviewer and pkill <pid> didn't nuke the program
damn. thought i'd disabled that trigger permenantly
Spaztic_One: use "kill -9 <pid>"
My external hard drive will not connect to ubuntu, it is the only problem i seem to have, its a 500gb WD elements external HDD, any other USB devices and external hard drives seem to work except this one

HUZZAH!

Yup
jacob_: so you can mount it manually?
i beleive i have been told to try this but it didnt work
I tried installing something with dpkg and it failed... but when I use apt-get, it references the file I tried to dpkg and fails to do what I want it to do: "E: Couldn't find package openoffice.org3.2-debian-menus_3.2-9502_all.deb"
i was on Linux forums, i can give you the link if you wish
hi i need help
jacob_: you can see all harddrives which ubuntu found via sudo fdisk -l
rowan_: ask and someone will help if they can
In retrospect, it probably would have been easier to simply ask how to locate/identify and kill a program using the terminal only. I was about 99% sure that it was teamviewer that was causing the problem
jacob_: then try sudo mount /dev/harddrive name(something like sdc1) /add the folder where you want to mount it
jkiv: not a good idea install packages from other distros
=== dgtl|screen is now known as dgtlchlk

who broke eject ?    it doesn't work when things are mounted other than /media   ???
xangua, trying to do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1404156 on 9.04.  Last step failed.  Trying to back out.
guest__: it won't eject if the mount is in use, it works fine for me from manual mount points though.
i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
=== wazzup is now known as wiiguy
guest__: use umount instead of eject :/
but you can't stop them*
so i should do something like this?
jacob@jacob-laptop:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda3/media
scampbell hmmm   i have to use umount because eject complains about blah not being under /media   ;/
jkiv: just extract the deb and install it, make sure to first remove openoffice from repository
im getting fed up with the sound on my ubuntu, it works some days and somedays it does not
yashi- pfft    yeah   umount and then manually open the tray

Seveas-train, ...hmm... if my memory is mostly free, then I would like to know why I just watched my hd scratch for over 2 min straight after I switched from Netbeans to Chrome ?
i checked and i have them all
guest__: Hmm, I just mounted a dvd to /mnt and ejected it. guess I'm of no use :(
any ideas guys?
xangua, doing so failed.  I'm trying to revert.  apt-get, for some reason, wants the location of the failed .deb.
I wish to make an empty .deb package that simply brings in other packages as dependencies.  Is there a name for this so I can learn how?
I have a core 2 duo with 4GB of RAM, Netbeans ans Chrome is open, but yet simply opening a terminal takes 30 seconds.
jacob_: are you sure it is sda3? sda is the name of the hard drive the numbers behind it represend the single partitions...im just wondering because sda is my primary device (internal)
is there a way to re-start alsa, this was easy to do in gentoo.  /etc/init.d/alsa restart
i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
top is not reporting the same thing as system-monitor
it might be just sdb
yashi- yeah  sda is usually the boot device
jacob_: type sudo fdisk -l it lists all devices you have
Yeah it must be /dev/sdb because its the only 500gb there
there ya go
jacob_: ok now you have to mount the device for example sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1
reggi: tried with chrome, didnt work i still get the video on my laptop instead of the TV
there has to be a folder in media called sdb1
reggi: even tho i have the browser on the TV screen not the laptop
sdb if it's not partitioned
its not partitioned
anyone know how to restart alsa?
jacob_: you should do that before mounting it
xanga, got it. I was in the dir with the .deb... Doing a wildcard openoffice* had it thinking it was a file satisfying the wildcard.
yashi- do what before mounting it ???
Why? and this is what i get, : jacob@jacob-laptop:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdb/media/sdb        mount: can't find /dev/sdb/media/sdb in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
Help Me Please
i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill. Eventually they go but i cant view any of my files or places
Is there any way to fix the bug where clicks constantly go "through" the title bar you're clicking on?
heh jacob_ missing a space between device and mountpoint
jacob_: you have to put a blank between the /dev/sdb<->and the mount folder
jacob_: /dev/sdb is the device.  /dev/sdb1 is the first partition on the device.  You only mount partititions.
jimbo no   wrong.  you only mount file systems.   you don't mount partitions
what do people do for scheduled backups on ubuntu - have been using the very powerful cobian on windows for the last year but i cant seem to find anything like it on windows ( GUI and scheduled and network backups ) .. thanks
Also guys I don't think it's beneficial to name mountpoints after partition names.  They can change, and then things get very confusing.
guest__: fair enough
but filesystems exist on partitions
jimbo you can have a file system without a partition
i have a network drive being shared by windows network and today when i sign in i get some thing on my desktop called "drive letter"onmedion.volume and in my places it is called x-nautilus-desktop: f on medion.volume however when i go to open this network drive it opens up alot of windows with the folder manager but you can't stop them with xkill.

yashi- i know my external HDD is working perfectly aswell because it mounts on windows and i can save, delete, watch films and play music from it
jacob_: 1.) you created the folder /home/jacob/usbdrive? if yes. eventually mount cant handle ntfs on its own(not sure, dont have ntfs) 3. your partitiontable is screwed
jacob_: do you use the save remove function in windows when you remove the drive?
safe or save?

what are the best programs for UBUNTU out there?

Kjeldor: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
DarkSector: kernels have a minor version that isn't reflected in uname, dpkg -l linux-image* will give you the full versions

jacob: you should try search for cant mount ntfs partition or something like that. im sure you will find a solution this way

what is the fastest way to clone linux systems? I have 1 system i need to clone into 95 machines
hello all
!clone
To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type <unconvertable> aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages <unconvertable> , move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type <unconvertable> sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install <unconvertable> - See also !automate
no, i mean clone hard drives, not package selection
wng-: http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cimages/cheader01.jpg
wng-: dd
wng-, use dd ?
i figured dd would be slow
wng-: but in more seriousness, there's dd, which can be kinda slow and ugly, but there's also partimage, which only copies the used parts of the drive.
wng-: its not
wng-: you can fiddle with the blocksizes and it will really go fast then
wng-: clonezilla?
bye
wng-: partimage is filesystem-aware, as is, I believe, Clonezilla, so it'll only copy used blocks of the drive, rather than all the zeroes or randomness that fills the rest of the drive.
:((
wng-: with 95 machines its probably worth looking into something more elaborate and powerful, like fai or preseeding or puppet

Is that the proper way to go about creating a new user and making it's default shell zsh in ubuntu?

Because, I got error when I tried with this command to send message "AT+CMGW="+85291234567"
thats fine, but the user was already made, if you just read my question...
forget it.... I'll just use my tried and true method.
terahert: You said " to setup a new user to experiment with zsh" . That implied to me you were creating, well, a new user.

yes, good idea :p
OBI1: I like xfce which goes along with the xubuntu desktop option
if selinux is disabled from blocking anything and iptables is open like i see.. you should be able to ping it.. and this action will show us that it is selinux and you will need to ask the experts of selinux how to fix this. selinux is still quite new at this time though.
and there is an #selinux channel here on freenode.

hi. how do I change my default desktop environment? Like now i have xfce but I want openbox . so what should i edit?
hey folks, looking for some help here. I had ubuntu 13.04 up and running, then I went to try to get hybrid graphics and vgaswitcheroo working. now I'm stuck on the ubuntu screen with the dots... any suggestions?
depends on what your display manager is, meet.
Orioa, I see a bug on this, here are some threads to look through. http://askubuntu.com/search?q=GeForce+7150M+
Mekaari_: how do I find that out?
but usually, you edit .xinitrc in your home directory.

meet: open .xinitrc and there should be something like
exec startxfce4
meet, install openbox, logout, change DE, login
Question, If i got 4 partitions on a laptop using windows 7, and i clear one of them out, put in a ubuntu CD for installing. Can i repartition this empty partition to a slightly smaller size and add a swap partition without damaging the 3 windows partitions with data on them?
change that to "exec openbox-session"
Gune, 4 primaries oe 3 and a extended with logical partitions are the limits per HD.
or*
OerHeks: actually I am currently on linux lite which is ubuntu based and uses "heavily modified xfce".  btw Mekaari_  I searched for .xinitrc in home but it is not there
OerHeks: so when I login there is no option to switch to openbox.

OerHeks: *logout
meet, in ubuntu there is, your lite version might be altered, i don't know
wilee-nilee: ah right, crap. Well, question 2. Can a usb drive run ubuntu well enough to allow for an IDE to run smoothly? An IDE such as netbeans, for c++/c coding and compiling
i have tried the 173 drivers that is what i am using now but it does not find my other monitor
meet, there is a #linuxlite channel it is not supported here.
Orioa, are you sure you have 173-updates, NOT nvidia-173 ?
yes
wilee-nilee: actually I asked over there but got no reply for a long time.
i have the additional driver window open
Gune, A usb is limited by its quality and the speed it can transfer to and from the computer. Many remove the firmware partition and have no problem, or put it in the extended you would add for ubuntu and the swap.
meet, Bummer, if you get support here it will just be incidental is all, most wont.
it works fine for the monitor on the laptop but does not let me use an additional monitor
Gune: I wouldn't recommend it even on my HDD it's slow :D

Hi there, im working on a document which has approx 40 images in, these are massive and its making the document 100+MB. I'm wanting to resize the photos, so i basically renamed the .odt to .tar.gz, extracted it, went into the pictures folder, resized them all, compressed it back up and then renamed it back to .odt, but its now all corrupted. Anyone know how to do what I want but without destroying the document?
AdvoWork: what did you rename it ? that does nothing
wilee-nilee: all right i am looking at the boot repair. sounds like i can install it so i will install it via the live Ubuntu
thewrath, Try the nomodeset first
wilee-nilee: I said that Linux Mint all ready boots w/o issue

thewrath, If you do not use the update while installing option, you can not get drivers you would have otherwise.

you mean 'gtk-recordmydesktop' ?
Dr_Willis, yes
looks like they save to your home by default.
but they may have some tmp file they use
where would the tmp files be
 /tmp/  would be my guess
flax_: Usually in /tmp, unless your $TMPDIR is set to something else

Do you have to install Ubuntu via USB to have "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows"?
skegeek:  options should be the same
biggest issue ive seen with that option. - IF you have 4 primary partions allready made. it may not allow it.
I tried installing 13.04 via CD, it didn't offer that option, only offered options for partitioninig.
Does it automatically partition using install alongside windows option?
personally i would resize/repartion manually.  but thats because i tend to know what i want. ;)
skegeek: When you are partitioning you can resize the existing Windows partitions.  That's what you do for dual boot.
I tend to let windows resize/shrink its own partions - befor i do the ubuntu install. windows seems a LOT faster at the task
skegeek, yes , it should , but "guided" partitioning is probly safer
skegeek: It would be really nice to make a backup before you start messing with it.
What's the internet daemon in 13.04 (from what I can enable/disable internet services)?
b0unce:  no such thing as far as i know. You manage services via the Upstart settings/scripts
!upstart
Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
how can i upgrade libreoffice(just this application) in ubuntu 13.04?
AdvoWork:  you want one thats newer then whats in the repos? if so use a PPA.
Dr_Willis: I remember something such inetd
b0unce: I don't have a 13.04 install handy to check, but isn't the default stil inetutils-inetd? You can do "dpkg -l | grep inetd" to check.
b0unce:  i dont think thats been used for years on ubuntu
wasent it xinetd ages ago?
Ampelbein: it gives me "update-inetd" as installed. Where's the conf file?
changed i mean
 locate inetd
/etc/inetd.conf
Dr_Willis: I don't have that file in /etc
b0unce: update-inetd is just a tool to enable/disable entries in /etc/inetd.conf
Dr_Willis, i dont know if im using the latest version anyway, can i do sudo apt-get update libreoffice ?
my inetd.conf is all... comments.. ;)
Ampelbein: alright, thanks. I think now it's clear.
AdvoWork:  some weird reason you dont want your whole system  up to date?
nopf, true
makes me wonder what inetd is actually doing.
*nope
Dr_Willis, taking up space
b0unce: It could be that you don't have any package installed that actually requires a superserver. In which case you could install inetutils-inetd or another.
I have resized to create Ubuntu partitions, however, partitions always seem to be a bit off of the size I specify.
i think it got pulled in  when i set up fail2ban perhaps
skegeek:  rounding to the nearest sector/clyinder or somthing i recall.
Dr_Willis: It's a server that reacts to connection requests on ports and starts the "real" server.
Ampelbein: Many thanks. :)
Dr_Willis: It saves memory and cpu due to fewer processes running as servers only get started when they are actually needed.
skegeek, dont forget 1024 bytes = 1 kb (not 1000) and the filesystem itself requires some space, and 5% is usually reserved for root so it appears as if its used

joufflu: also look a bit around - irssi alone is not that fun - but the scripts make it pretty useful!
weechat also has basically a 'package manager' for its scripts
;)
oooohhhh, shiny!
but you WILL want to read the weechat docs/guides/starter guide
also theres a weechat-android client that connects to your weechat session.
but its a bit crashy right now
well, usually i use tmux+irssi
tmux is some kind fo screen - but better ;)
that weechat thing looks interesting!
for ages i used znc+weechat+tmux or whatever :) but with znc - the use of  tmux was a little overkill
raspberry pi = my znc/irc server/gateway ;)
id connect to it via znc from any other client. then i basically was here 24/7 :)
3+ differnt pcs/irc clients --> all connected to the same znc  server, all routeing me here.
i could go to any pc in the house, or tablet/phone and still be on the same nick/session here.

hey
Dr_Willis: i don't get the idea behind an irc bouncer. here is what i do: tumx + irssi some where. and then ssh to that computer and open the tmux sessions. what value will an irc bouncer add for me?
dpkg returned an error code (1)
nabblet:  as i said eralier - i have 4 pcs in the house.. all go to the bouncer.. then they show whats here.
they can be running ANY irc client. it dosent matter.
i chat here.. go to the garrage..  that pc/client shows the same dialog/info.
i turn off all 4 pcs' the znc server stays here and logs stuff.. i connect via phone.. it shows the history. I never 'appear' to leave here
so. No ned to use ssh/tmux, any client can have a peristant session.
and multi clients appear as a single client here.

like i click start key on keyboard and nothing comes up
how do i run command

tnx wiak
follow the Black screen on boot Fix (uninstall driver) part
well, i'll use that script then
jfklsdajkfsda:  you do or do not get a graphical Login screen? (lightdm)
and then install driver again jfklsdajkfsda
i got it after i restarded pc couple of times, and after i did some stuff in recovery mode
Dr_Willis i had the same problem, it comes from xorg and driver not being friends ;)
jfklsdajkfsda:  somthing else to try is to make a new user via the console and  see if they aork.
wiak:  ive seen it happen for dozens of reasons. ;)  (the no panels bit)
right, i have no panels
<- had black screen
but don't have black screen anymore
just no panels
jfklsdajkfsda:  try the guest user, and making a new user. see if they work. if SO then that points to a user setting issue
check /.config folder
Dr_Willis: yeah the most simple is to make a new user
yeah, but how do i make a new user
if i can't open any system related tools
sudo adduser billgates
at the console
and how to open console :p
run the Terminal
rly... is there some shortcut?
lol i know
but how
I am trying to set up cups and samba to serve the windows drivers as needed but I am running into an error: WERR_ACCESS_DENIED

use the console.. thats the easy way
anybody any ideas?
but how to open console
what do i press
i don't have it on desktop
alt-ctrl-f1
ok thank you
its not a desktop thang. ;)
then sudo service lightdm restart             to restart the X server
ok
will try
you can reconfigure the driver with amdconfig --initial

LeinardoSmith_: well, no context, but that looks like a samba error, or an error from a windows AD domain

net -S localhost -U root rpc rights grant root SePrintOperatorPrivalege
common with bad samba setup
because I am trying to use cupsaddsmb

on the last step
I have a major problem, my new mediacenter pc only lets me plug in an extra monitor when windows is running, but if I use linux - no matter what driver I use - the system crashes whenever I try to use two monitors.
LeinardoSmith_: well, that looks like your local samba server is rejecting you, probably because there is no such thing as "root" user in samba, unless you set on up
ikonia I tried adding root using smbpasswd
LeinardoSmith_: I'd confirm your authentication is working first - then move onto tasks such as this
ok what would you suggest?
confirming your authentication is working, then trying to do things such as set roles
Hi, Does anybody here know how can I scan with mfc-j435w in ubuntu?
getting "access denied" suggests your basic auth is failing
Ubuntu's default zip/rar manager seems really crappy. Is there any of them that have a better interface?
confirm thats working first
ok how would I do that?
smbclient perhaps
could we move this to pm? (as I think it might take a little while)
sorry no, I'm about to leave.
ok could you walk me through
how to hide my ip here?
Ljube: ask in #freenode
LeinardoSmith_: man smbclient

Just installed as a dual-boot with Windows 8, however, there isn't an entry in boot menu to launch Ubuntu instead of Windows.
hi, i install ubuntu 12.04 x64 along with win 7 home premium., i check my hard drive and i have two new partitions (before i only have 2), so ubuntu is installed, but now does not showme grub menu, any ideas?
skegeek:  which boot menu> You mean in GRUB?
yes, goes directly in windows
skegeek:  or did you do a WUBI install and are using the windows boot thing?
!fixgrub
GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
the boot-repair tool from a live cd - is the easy way to fix most grub issues
No, Windows boot menu.
I didn't over-write incase something went wrong, which has happened before.
the windows boot menu cant boot ubuntu as far as i know. it can do wubi.
you could install grub to a usb flash drive and use that to boot the ubuntu install i guess if you ar really worried about it
It has to be possible.
I dont see why it would be worth the effort. unless it can be set to chainload the grub from a ubuntu partition
hi, how can i cleanly unmount an external harddisk. i mean, it is unmounted (software) but it is still spinning.
if its unmountd you can unplug it.
i recall there being 2 ways that th gui 'eject.unmounts' external media. one actually disconnects/powers off the device. to remount it - you must unplug/plug it back in. other way (the normal way) just unmounts the filesystem
it is still spinning as if it were working
also i got error about mounting unchecked fs and so
what filesystem is on the device?
so i'm a bit unconfortable with unplugging it
ext2
man sdparm
if its Unmounted. then the system no longer can write to it. now it MAY be trying to do a final sync  as part of the unmounting
sorry
check 'dmesg' output to see if theres any error messages about the drive perhaps.
all nice
does mount say its unmounted?
http://paste.ubuntu.com/6049683/
yes
mount
nothing about my external hdd is there
also ftab does not mention it
your warning  was given when you tried to mount sdc2
fstab dosent need to mention it. ;)   if Mount says its not mounted then it should be safe to remove
i think so - don't know when it exactly came up
the strang thing is: i am sure that sometimes the hdd comes to halt
you should proberly be fscking sdc2 some time soon.
wehn i unmount
usb drives power down  when not used in many cases
yeah, did that just now
mine actually can spin down  while mounted.. so they have to spin up befor i can access them
https://answers.launchpad.net/ejecter/+question/63177
Dr_Willis: see what growningneeds said in there ^
Right-clicking an external USB HDD and selecting unmount still resulted in a spinning HDD with LED lights on. What I do now (in a terminal) is this:
1. umount /dev/sdb1
2. sudo sdparm --command=sync /dev/sdb1
3. sudo sdparm --command=stop / dev/sdb1
i just UNMOUNT my external usb hds and pull them out
i dont see the need for  the rest of those commands
well, usally that's what i do too - but the hdd is spinning as if it were under load
that's why i hesitate
also it's my backup hdd
:P
if you unmount and 'disconnect/power down' the hd using those commands..  then you will have to physically unplug/plug it back in (or reuse the commands) to remount it i imagine. the kernel wont be seeng the drive.
http://askubuntu.com/questions/56270/how-can-i-spin-down-external-hard-drive
ive definatly seen people 'unmount' usb devices then gparted wont see them, because they have also been disconnected from the system
mine spin down automatically :)
mine do too... sometimes
i can't tell what it depends on
the bios/firmware of the drive controller
my old hds dont.. new ones all do it here.
hm, mine was bought before summer 2008
udisks --detach /dev/sdb
that spinned it down
now see if 'sudo blkid' or 'sudo fdisk -l' shows it
neither of them shows it
[01:26]  * gimmenick reconnects physically
now both of your commands show the ext. hdd
so IF you wanted to unmount and repartion the drive/resize the filesystms or fsck them.. thenyou dont want to 'detatch' the disk ;)
Ive seen people have that issue where they unmount/eject (or whatever the file manager said) and it actually detatched the disk. so they couldent work on them
they unplug/plug it back in.. it would remount..  they unmount. cant find the disk. ;) it was a endless loop.
Had to tell them to use the unmount command of the shell so they could repartion the hd.
Ive noticed in teh past that sometimes nautilus would have a 'unmount' and 'eject' on some devices. Im guessing eject some how detatched/powered down the device
Hmm. On 13.10 i notice i got a 'Unmount'  and 'Format...'    'remove and rename' are greyed out,
wonder how often a normal user would need a 'format...' item like that
Dr_Willis: it's not about the formating for me
Dr_Willis: i am worried about "hardstopping" a hdd
hi, i have win 7 home primium and installed ubuntu 12.10 x64 in my hard drive, now i have 4 partitions , but my system boots direcltly into windows 7, if have bios set to legacy, system bots but not into grub2, i follow the steps in !grub2 topic but when i try to sudo install-grub /dev/sda the system said error can not boot because grub can not read /boot/grub deal, any ideas or any program
can help me to, the boot-rescue iso does not boot here, thanks
its just somthing to watch out for if you ever do need to unmount somthing to fsck, or format, or repartion it.
Dr_Willis: ok
ese:   if you can boot a ubuntu live cd., you can install the boot-repair tool onto it and use that
Dr_Willis: i have eject too, but it didn't do anything
gimmenick:  so your USB hd has eject and unmount?
is this a usb flash or usb hd?  see if tey all have the same items.
Dr_Willis: yes. but ejecting doesn't really do anything, when the hdd is unmounted
eject - on an optical drive - will open the tray
had a guy convinced once that it would also send his usb flash drive across the room.. told him to be ready to catch it....   ;)
:P
i wonder if the differnt menu items also depend on if its mounted via the fstab. or auto-mounted vya the gvfs stuff
hm
maybe it is related to that
daftykins: ftp goes at 100 MB/s
elso when i change to uefi in bios the grub from my usb boot device goes into text mode and showme a lot more options but none is the rescue mode, if i go to prompt and type rescue grub said can not find that, any ways if i go legacy in bios the usb shoiwme 4 options, try ubuntu, install, memtest and boot into hd, no rescue, ...thank you
so its only SFTP and SMB that is soo slow..
i mean after all: if i mount it, its more of a gvfs thing
i think my problem is ubuntu installs in uefi mode by default, is there a way i can install in legacy mode?
since windows is in lagacy mode too
Dr_Willis: i think there is a way to see what files and such is currently "open"
somthing with stat in it
it's not in my bash_history any more :(

uninstalling and reinstalling to fix things is sort of a 'windows mindset'

!info e17 | SixtyFold
SixtyFold: e17 (source: e17): Enlightenment DR17 Window Manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.16.999.70492-2 (raring), package size 2455 kB, installed size 6280 kB
(just a guess)
sorry for the fragmented posts too, lol
is it lighter weight than LXDE?
lotuspsychje:  thanks
SixtyFold, naah
SixtyFold: remember oldskool enlightment?
hanasaki, The info was in >config
.config
lotus - naw, never seen that one before
will have to give it a try though, see what it's like
i wanted to try lxde ande e17 on my old laptop but i am having issues
wilee-nilee:  huh?
(think the laptop's hardware is dying)
SixtyFold: you should try it, i think lubuntu remains the lightest one
kostkon: i'd think e17 and lxde would be "close" in resource usage...
i think those two DE's would do good on that system
hanasaki, Thought was worng sorry
Hi there. How do i backup every setting in ubnutu 12.04 without backing up any personal files just in case i mess up anything and may not be able to boot anymore or correct a setting?
wilee-nilee:  what is in config?>
zykotick9, i think lxde is lighter, with less graphical effects. i think now e17 is opengl based or smthing. at least it uses a lot of compositing
since #rtorrent is dead.. what happens if I delete a rtorrent session file?
i have to use a crt with it since the LCD lamp is out (not worth fixing that on a "2001/2002" laptop, in my opinion) ... and even just booting the liveUSB, everything seems to be starting fine and then the CRT goes out and doesn't come back on
hayer: try transmission aswell, pretty neat package
i mean booting up ... its like it shuts off and stays "off" .. the CRT itself is fine
lotuspsychje: no. im using rtorrent + rutorrent
no lose cables either
kostkon: e17 is actually very light... i've only used it myself in it's 16.999 version (almost 17) but it's very light actually (i'd find opengl/composting hard to believe actually - i found it too buggy at the time)
my newer laptops is fine with almost all of the DE's (it doesn't 'need" e17 .. but i do like E17, myself)
zykotick9, right, i believe you. youve actually tried it, unlike myself, so yeah :D
hanasaki, It's .config in home unhide the folders and take a look it is many setups for your regular and added apps.
for recent computers E17 will run fine with low resources
wilee-nilee:  thanks... nothing on thunderbird there
hanasaki, Yeah I saw that I thought there would be.
its all in the .thunderbird folder
wilee-nilee: looks like the easy way is to make a new profile and setup all the accounts again :(
hanasaki, were you setting up an encrypt?
wilee-nilee:  nope  why/
kostkon: FYI i see "!info e17" shows ubuntu is using the 16.999 version of e17 (ie NOT the e17 final)
hanasaki, JUst thought that might have been a cause, just a guess, someone was on earlier doing that.
zykotick9, true. e17 (0.16.999.70492-2)
kostkon: well, i tried e17 0.17.3, it was a 30MB download!  BUT, it's segfaulting in my VM (possibly due to lack of 3d support?  which this VM doesn't have.  or perhaps because it's still buggy ;)  but i can't verify if it needs 3d or not...
zykotick9, it could be. i still think it requires opengl capable graphics drivers :P
kostkon: by way of comparison, lxde is a 270MB download!
zykotick9, hmm weird
kostkon: e17 is CRAZY light man...
zykotick9, lol

Any one that can help me with LibreOffice Writer macros?
i remember when i thought @500mhz was blazing fast
how times change
zykotick9, hmm 270 v 30. it's a lot. dont know where is coming from. maybe because lubuntu-desktop has a long list of deps. however, just the lxde package alone depends on much fewer packages.
kostkon: that 270 is just the lxde package(s) ;)  it's ALMOST finished installing.
tim, Just tell the channel the problem for help. ;)
zykotick9, oh ok

Hello, I am having trouble figuring out macros. Specifically SetRowHeight in libreoffice writer. I used the record macro but this is the only setting that didn't get recorded. I'm positive it is a simple quick fix in the script. What to do?
raphael, english here.
tim: i'm 95% sure there is a libreoffice channel (either on freenode or oftc), i'd suggest trying to find it (on freenode try alis, "/msg ubottu alis" for details)
hmm there a open/libre office channel ?? ..that may be a better place to look
Hi I need help, when I click in the System Configuration icon the cursor starts to load but the System Configuration menu dont open
several closet seemed to be #libreoffice-devs
Can someone help me?
zykotick9: no one is replying so I am trying here...
I feel like any one who know BASIC could help here.

Not sure what to try next, I can only get two monitors to work in windows. In linux my system crashes and I am afraid to try again, this problem has occurred with different drivers and on different distributions.
Where can I get the Ubuntu boot screen and login screen and how do I apply them so they can be used? Thanks in advance.
CountryfiedLinux, Can you give the back on why they are missing?
kostkon: lxde ends up pulling in, quite a bit of gnome (i guess understandably), which explains it's MUCH larger size than e17.  BUT... e17 failed on my VM, lxde works OOTB!  so my scorecard: e17 = 0 vs lxde = 1 (there is a clear winner from where i sit ;)  thanks for reminding me that e17 exists, and that it's still isn't up to "my" quality standards ;)  [i enjoyed the "test" though :) ]

ianananan, no problem.
max64: 1) it's 13.04 2) do you have ANY other details?  did it always happen?  does it happen when you are doing something in specific?  are you using nvidia/ati/other non-free graphics drivers?
can anyone help me with my problem?
max64, WE need details to help, hardware might be a good start, and what you have done so far.

max64, HOw many times have you unplugged it?
wilee-nilee:i alwayes unplug electricity after hanging
anyone know anything about a virtual network based computer or is that virtual machine such as xen? i want to hook like 3 rasberry pie-like devices together and have them function as one computer tasking proccesses distributively
max64, That can damage a OS alone, how many times?
i agree with wilee-nilee
when i start the laptop it get hanged after about 20 min then i have to unplug
i did it now about 3 times
when is it hanging?
hexacode: what you are looking for is called "clustering", and that's NOT what xen does (xen is for virtualization, the opposite).  fyi, clustering is pretty complicated...  best of luck.
xmetal:when i open programs
max64, I would make another user and see if this happens there, this is a knock out the variables situation, could be any number of possibilities from hardware to software
i'd look at what is starting when linux starts ... and remove anything i dont need (also a useful tip to solve issues in other OSs too)
thats another way to solve it (@ what willie said

hexacode: sidenote - if you happen to compile a lot of gcc code, look into distcc (that i had a lot of success with, back in the day).  but other then that, i did have some kernel based linux clustering support back-in-the-day as well, but i forget what is was called open<insert3lettershereiforgetnow>.  hope it's easier now a days.

max64, Why the picture?
there a scripting channel?
wilee-nilee:i think the processor fan suddenly go aloud voice
wilee-nilee:the picture show the programs working and the CPU power
i would either do what i said (obvously :P ) or what wilee suggested ... create another user and see if ithat hangs too or on the "hanging" profile/user ... look at how many things is starting
and remove things (uncheck them "auto starting")  you dont need at bootup
max64, its gone now and really not an answer to making a new user.
i had the distro i use do that ... i was downloading as much as i could on high speed and that distro was crippled on bootup .. i found all my installing (packages) added a ton of startup items ... i unchecked those and it was back tonormal again

max64, Install lm-sensors and check the temperatures maybe, I can't really go through every possibility for one.

Greetings.  I was looking for some help with apt-get on 13.10.  To install a 32bit package on a 64bit os, I thought you could use apt-get install libsdl2-dev:i386, or libsdl2-dev:amd64.  I get package not found when I attempt to do that.  (Using a debootstrap created chroot of 13.10)

hi, I'm using ubuntu 12.04 on an inspiron 14z and having problems wuth my usb ports. sometimes it works sometime doesn't works. can someone help me?
zerocom, you sure it's the ports?  usb sticks do fail ...
the usb pendrives and discs are ok, the ports are ok too because I tested with other OS. when I said ports I wish to say the problem is in ubuntu. sorry
zerocom, what's the behavior that makes you suspicious.  details ...
grahamsavage, did your issue ever get resolved?
cfhowlett, perhaps you know?
ok, sometimes when I connect pendrives or my external discs nothing happens. Then I try again and again.
is an intermittent behaviour
I have usbmount installed
zerocom, you install that due to problem?
yes, reading a tutorial in the web, but I know  its doesn't work becausa before install the problem was the same
zerocom, Any fat or ntfs partitions that may need a chkdsk?
zerocom: the next time that "stuff" happens, open a terminal, and type "dmesg" it'll scroll a lot of stuff past you, but read the end stuff (that you can still see).  look for stuff dealing with sdXY.  when you unplug/replug the USB, try running dmesg in between and looking for changes (on that same last screen, that you can actually see when you run dmesg ;)
exi
zykotick9, I tried that, but don't remember the results, I will try again.
wilee-nilee, my pendrive and discs works fine on another OS and in my smartTV
zerocom, What other OS?
[04:13]  * zykotick9 is unignoring wilee-nilee, although he recommeds using non-free software on a regular bases...
Win XP
in my works there is a Win XP machine
zerocom, Linux is picky if the partitions are corrupted is all, XP working not a comparison.
ok
what do u recommend?
Working with multiarch,  how would you install the 32bit and 64bit versions of libpng12-dev?  apt-get install libpng12-dev:i386 libpng12-dev:amd64 conflicts.
zerocom, if those are MS formatted partitions I would consider checking them in computer with a right click or running a chkdfsk /f/r on them
chkdsk /f/r that is
conathan: not all packages are multiarch capable... some do conflict... good luck.
ah.
[04:19]  * zykotick9 is re-ignoring wilee-nilee, because he supports non-free software on a regular bases...  [OPs: i know annoucing ignores is frowned upon, it's only because i annouced the unignore, that i'm doing this]
zykotick9: I think the lucked helped,  been working on this half the day, and just realized why it's conflicting.  I'm installing the dev packages, while it's the i386 libraries I wanted to install
conathan: ;)  glad you figured it out man!

wilee-nilee, yesterday i stumble upon your http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2002028&page=8
its even in the official repos now. ;)
this proved quite useful for me :D
i've been trying to find a way to enable the unity gmail webapp for an hour with no luck? how/where can I do this?
Dr_Willis, in official repos it is 1.6 and current version is 1.8 so i was trying to get 1.8 version.
then you would want to find a PPA.
what i wanted to ask is, if multiple DE are installed they will interfere with each other and offer obstacles in proper functioning ?
pero:  i thought when you went to the gmail site it should just ask to enable the webapp thing. but i really find the whole webapp 'feature' a bit useless
no it doesn't do that - i'm using chromium and on 13.10
xtriz, I remember that thread that took awhile to get them cleaned up took a chroot. ;)
I thought webapps only worked with firefox.
but i could be wrong
i'm finding my tabs a little cluttered these days so I wouldn't mind leaving trying it out in the unity panel
no
it's supposed to be chromium and firefox
i have installed using the ppa, everything works, but only issue i am facing is slight lag, when i drag my windows it get's bit blurred during the motion .
my unity panel is to cluttered. ;)
i run Linux Mint with a number of DE's and they do not "harm" each other
xmetal, they work absolutely fine without any prob ?
xmetal:  ive definatly seen people break things by trying some de's :) that dont like others.. like trying to put gnome2 on with gnome3 and so forth. ;)
xtriz:  there may be some effects settigns you can disable.
because right now i have xfce, unity, cinnamon and elementary :P
well 2 versions of the same DE in a sence
i could see issues then
try getting gnome2 going with gnome-shell ;) and you will see pain.
i have mate, Cinn, xfce, lxde, e17 (enlightenmint)  all behave fine
I just use bash shell and links. I need to upgrade to this decade.
May someone help me?How to solve the problem "warning: ft_render: skipping missing glyph for character"?
i have noticed that cinn in mint 15 in lagging though in 14 on the same machine it was fine
i think cin 1.8 (for mint 15) and cinn 1.6 (??) for mint 14
xmetal, yeah correct
 i am not sayings its impossible .. but if you stick with the repos ... you should be ok (as in not having DE's conflict)
i have not experienced any issues with having "too many DE's"
xmetal, good :)
so i can move forward experimenting things.
ages and ages ago.. if you had kde and gnome both installed. :) it could cause weirdness.. but i havent really seen any issues with differnt de's in well.. years
in mint i even downloaded (i think i have the name right) "ubuntu-desktop" (I am sure this means Unity with a few extras)
!info ubuntu-desktop
ubuntu-desktop (source: ubuntu-meta): The Ubuntu desktop system. In component main, is optional. Version 1.299 (raring), package size 3 kB, installed size 58 kB
meta packages just pull in a lot of other packages. an easy way to 'group' things
(while i was on high speed internet and was downloading as much as possible)
and i backed up all the DEBS too :)
but now they are all outdated. ;P
lol true
i love downloading software and then after its installed it says "new version availible"
i mean i JUST downloaded it
with gentoo.. by the time you got the latest compiled.. theres a new version.
I went from here to Gentoo once.
Tis a silly place.
Arch is nice, but I always come back to Ubuntu
I dont have much need for the other disrtos on my PC.  now on my Pi. I play with some of the differnt ones.
but they tend to be more specilized
I actually want about 3-6 Pis because I want to play with VMs
ah not as bad as slackware (I love slackware but its a pain at times) ... have to install 100 dependencies from the tarballs, mannually
then you end up forgetting the INTIAL program you were trying to install in the first place
lol
Yea, I had the same problem with Gentoo. Spent 4 hours trying to set the correct use flags to get the dependencies for Firefox
Then forgot what I was trying to install... When went to go try to google how to do something and was like "Oh yea. Need a browser"
i mean I (before version 14) last use mint when @ Ubuntu 9.04 was out ...and wanted to try Mint again .. If i was on high speed and/or had more pc's (to try it on) .. I'd get the newest ubuntu
i think the two are so similar though
i like trying new distros (just to see what they are like)
:)
i dont see much point in Mint.  Some of their projects are finally making it into the default ubuntu repos however.
either or
i know i get grief for mentioning mint in here sometimes, but they are so alike i think, that many of the issues a user may have (say with a DE) would apply to either Idstro
ack
distro *
   back when i tried mint (version number ???? ) when Ubuntu 9.04 was new ... they looked 100% alike to me
( i am sure there may have been suttle diffewrences though)

getting this error while trying to install mysql
try a differnt mirror perhaps.
you have done an sudo apt-get update  recently?
universal:  id reinstall the flash-installer package from the repos. and let it do it
universal:  the askubuntu.com site may have some guides on how to properly use the flash archive from adobe. I never use it that way
If adobe changes the version# or somthing to their flash archives on their sites - it can break the flash-installer package/tools unfortunatly. Untill they get changed.
Dr_Willis: to me ?
lemonsparrow:  yes. try a update/upgrade and try again. if still fails. try another mirror
Dr_Willis: well the version in adobe archieve and ubuntu repo is same - falsh- x.x.202.297 and I did it before so i know its works.....but I dont know what happened this time.....maybe the ubuntu-restricted-extras package flash script is still hanging on for download and install and maybe thatswhy its blocking blocking it ?
Dr_Willis: when I do sudo apt-get update this is what I get http://pastebin.com/U6wQSYgg
ubutu-restricted-extras just pulls in the flash-installer package  same as if you installed it by itself.
I also did sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer but it says its already installled and of the newest version
perhaps 'reinstall' the flashplugin-installer

Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) was the thirteenth release of Ubuntu. !End-Of-Life on April 10th, 2012, see http://ubottu.com/y/maverick for details.
lemonsparrow:  you are using 10.10 ?
Dr_Willis: yes
notice how ALL the servers are 404? ;)
its End of Life..  its time to upgrade.
yea....but that time it was unable to fetch it.....and there is a script for flash and mscorefnts in ubuntu-restricted package for a later download and install...that I clicked to download and install now
once a release goes EOL the servers get moved to some archive-servers so those in your sources.list are no longer valid.
!eol
End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
when I try to update to 11.04 from update manager it says fetching failed. There may be a n/w problem
Dr_Willis: ^
see the !EOL url given. you MUST alter your sources.list
Or just do a clean install. (faster)
Dr_Willis: can I do clean install without having to format or backup ?
wtf.....I purged the flashplugin-installer package and it marked it for removal ad started downloading mscorefonts now Dr_Willis
lemonsparrow:  err.. you do a clean install. its a clean system. No backups = you lost anything on the system.
thats sort of what 'clean' means., :)
Dr_Willis: this is how my source.list looks http://pastebin.com/CYmh0YUG can you modify this for me as to how it should be really look like

Hi guys could you please help me, my sound has suddenly disappeared. I'm sure the my headphones are okay, because when I boot into windows the sound is okay.
I didn't do anything in particular. Didn't modify the sound driver or anything since the instalation of my system.
Dr_Willis: ?
lemonsparrow:  i always do clean installs. so ive rarely had to  fight with upgradeing a release AFTER its gone eol.
Dr_Willis: help me please..
looks like you dident change archive in all the lines at the end.
Dr_Willis: I dont know much abt these stuffs.. I wanna get through this without much time.. like I dont wanna do format n all that something easy and fast :)
reinstalling most lilkely will be faster then upgradeing

I've tried typing in my password, and then using the magic sysrq, and nothing happened
I'd still take out the graphics card if you suspect it, could be pulling down the bus.
Do the keyboard indicators work?
pnunn, no they don't
pnunn, what did you want her to do with the video card again?
hi, where can i get some help in regards to issues with mount?
After taking it out
TuxThePenguin, try booting with monitors connected to motherboard, I think
TuxThePonguin, sounds like there is on board graphics as well, so try that without the card, but sounds pretty low level.
Yeh, just one monitor though, keep it simple.
pnunn, right
Makes sense to me :)
process of elimination.
Along with Occam's Razor
zelot: If you are on a supported release of 'buntu, this is a good place to ask.
Any solution is most likely the simplest one
I'm a emacs newb and looking to prevent rsi. I'm using a thinkpad keyboard. Any emacs users here please recommend a good keybinding strategy? Thanks.
I am having difficulties mounting an external network drive on ubuntu. It was working fine a couple of days ago and now its not working. I can access the file via smbclient just fine
this is the file from fstab: 10.2.0.77:wmware /media/beefcake nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0
pnunn, TuxThePenguin, alright, so pulling the graphics card did not help
So, it could be the motherboard or the monitor
sounds like we just witnessed a MB going south
What is MB?
Mother Board
How many monitors do you have there? Just to be sure, try all the video connectors, but it doesn't sound good.
quick question about print settings. i have everything set in printer options through admin panels, and also through cups web interface. but each time i go to print the default settings do not match what i have set. even though on checking them they are still set correctly system wide. just not in individual programs, ie. browsers, ocular etc
Then yes, I agree
The other thing you can try is just wiggle (technical term) all of the connectors, including the power one, just to be sure there all seated. properly.
hannasanarion, did you restart your computer? Get a BSOD?
alright, i'll wiggle all the connectors, and then try my vga monitor
Before the problem I mean
is there a second location these preferences are kept? a file somewhere that is for whatever reason not being overwritten
anyone? :/
TuxThePenguin, no, It had just been crashing every once in a while (mostly when running several youtube videos at once, or viewing an imgur album), so I turned it off to check the hard drive
try different monitors, different video ports, check ALL connections, etc...
I'm t wiggling all the connections, and plugging in the other monitor now
Okay, well I think the crashing is a RAM issue
zelot: While awaiting the network gurus, does the mount point "/media/beefcake" still exist, and can yoy ping 10.2.0.77 ??
yes to both
Good thought TuxThePenguin pop the ram out and re-seat it too hannasanarion.
The crashing-while-watching-YouTube thing usually means RAM, and since you seem to possibly be having a video problem...maybe they are linked?
sorry i missed everything cause i just joined, is it not booting?
No, she doesnt get video
And it seems peripherals are failing too
so how are we sure it isn't booting? with no video.
Yeah, you're right...sorry XD
Zethrok: Sorry, I do not know else.. others will have to advise.
more so, how are we sure it is not that the machine will not boot
no beeps, no keyboard lights
ya that's not booting
Also, she mentioned it crashing after having too many youtube videos open. That's a RAM issue most likely... I dont know if that can be linked or not
hey, I've never done RAM before, any tricks on getting it back in?
the ram is a good place to start. try removing all sticks of ram and booting, if it works: add one at a time until you find the dead one.
Just make sure it's the right way around (will only go one way) then just push hard, it takes a bit of force to get the latches back down.
yes, you GENTLY hold the side tabs open
One end at a time.
hannasanarion, yes. some are inserted at an angle, then rocked into the straight position.. one sec
latches, side tabs, same diff
robjloranger: it won't boot without the ram in
No, but it should beep like crazy.
no beeping
hannasanarion, did you get any beeps?
With Windows 8.1 dual booting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the partition manager in the installer doesn't recognised the free space not allocated to the NTFS partition.
Doesn't sound good.
Could the BIOS be failing?
Don't suppose you have a multi meter handy.
Wondering what the issues is with this, someone said this could be to do with Windows new dynamic disks, however the disk type on the free space partition is basic.
no I don't, and I'm jobless atm, so I would really rather not go get one
By failing, I mean could it not be loading
[02:41]  * ObrienDave votes for MB fail or CMOS battery died
sounds like some sort of motherboard issue, weather bios or full blown dead mother board it's hard to say
OK, could just eliminate the power supply with one. Doesn't sound too promising though.
It might be BIOS i think...but power supply is a good idea too
^^
Any ideas?
if it's a power problem, would the fan and hard drive be spinning?
hannasanarion, are you getting any fans or anything? no light on the case?
all the lights are working properly
fans and hard drives are spinning
Yeh hanna, they can, could have 12V but not 5V. Seen that before.
Then its BIOS i think
ok so PS (powersupply) sounds fine
is it very old?
What is hannasanarion issue? I might have had something similar before.
Not so fast on that one robjloranger, seen one rail of a supply go down and keep things like fans happy. Could be as simple as no power good line.
No, got it winter 2010
benwright, she cant boot up it seems
no beeps, no keyboard lights
Alright, where does it fail in the boot process?
So you see the BIOS screen?
from the get go
There is no boot process.
I don't know. No display, no bios
no video either
She sees nothing at all
Yeah, hardware failure.
Well, maybe
It could be BIOS
we made it that far :)
it's not the gpu, and it's not the RAM
If you don't see the bios screen at all, you motherboard may be fried.
Pretty unlikely Tux, if no sign of life at all. More likely MB
What is your motherboard model?
that's where i'm headed
Okay, good point
I have had the same thing before.
how could that have happened though? it was working fine before I opened it
me too
Luckily motherboards are not too expensive.
Been a while since I've had a hardware failure of this magnitude
you opened it? what did you do once inside?
it's a HP p6610f, all stock except graphics
hannasanarion Lots of reasons, possibly a fault in the product. How old is the motherboard?
I wiggled the hard drive to see if it was loose, (it's not), then i blew out some dust
Since it's stock, how old is the machine itself
2010
6706f here :) canada?
no, Arizona
Got a warranty to cover it?
Generally a motherboard will have a set of LEDs on it
That flash to indicate error codes.
:( i thought the f was for french/english like here in canada.. anyway, sorry off topic
here's the mb
You can always start the boot, look at the leds and decode them to the respective error.
Manufacturer: FoxconnMotherboard Name: H-ALVORIX_HF-RS880-uATXHP/Compaq motherboard name: Alvorix-GL8E
Not sure if this is ubuntu/debian centric or what, but why is it that when I run php code in the CLI (php file.php) I get a ton of SNMP OID messages?  There's no snmp code in the php
Foxconn, isnt that the Japanese manufacturer for apple? (off-topic I know)
What I did when this happened was I got the motherboard manual, and I looked at the led error codes and then found out my motherboard was fucked :P

Sorry I was on #ubuntu before !language existed :/
foxxconn is chinese I think
in 2007
benwright: then you know to avoid swearing...
well, anyways could your hard drive's data be affected from a MB failure
well, i assume not, and I have the important stuff backed up
somsip Yep, best ban words not the context they are used in.
Okay, that's good at least.
somsip You can have horrific opinions that don't use "curse" words.
somsip: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7661497/
Yep, so if you aren't seeing the BIOS screen the HD isn't the issue.
At least it is failing before that point.
yeah, thre's 5 leds, labelled cr1-5, and cr5 is lit green
Green is usually a positive color
Alright, so in the motherboard manual that probably means something, green usually indicates good.
only if it's a dual color led
Do you hear the disk spinning?
yes
So, hypothetically if the motherboard isnt failing or dead, what could it be?
So alternatively you may not be seeing the BIOS screen because you aren't rendering the framebuffer to a monitor...
And it is booting.
I heard the disk spinning when it first booted,but not afterwards
dino82: try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21257589/ubuntu-typing-php-in-terminal-shows-a-lot-of-errors
Oh, hmm
Still sounds like a motherboard failure.
when you try to cold boot, from fully off, does one of the led's blink in a pattern?
What component on the board did you change when it started failing
Could it be a virus? I agree with MB failure but is a virus a possibility?
Or did it randomly fail this morning?
thanks, I'll try it again
no
worked, thanks
TuxThePenguin little or no chance its a virus.
A virus would want your PC to boot so it could steal your credit card info.
dino82: np
And no, wouldn't be that.
robjloranger: the light is always on, nothing changes when I boot
Either your GPU or motherboard has failed.
Sounds like the motherboard.
If you have another board you can test the GPU in isolation
so there is no error code via led
DO you have a spare?
or psu
benwright: the failure didn't randomly happen, it happened after I took it apart to do a little cleaning
:/ Static damage?
Oh you could have shorted out the board
I took the gpu out to see if the computer would boot without it, and no dice
benwright, robjloranger, use nicks to preface answers to others here please
mxcxrts, sure no problem
if it's static damage or a short, can it be fixed, or am I out of luck
I actually had a question of my own, but I thought I would earn some credit before asking it :P I don't know if I have been that much help.
cool thanks
hannasanarion when you say take apart can you expand on the extent of what you did
hannasanarion Integrated circuits make that almost impossible.
benwright: go for it. The hardware support issue is well off topic anyway
benwright, what's your question?
We can take this over to the offtopic channel
If that helps somsip
TuxThePenguin: that would be helpful, thanks
Well I noticed in Windows 8.1 that when making a free partition space this isn't detected by Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Well, I'll be over there.
Okay, what's the name of the offtopic channel?
Which is a bit annoying, I am guessing this is windows not being compatible from my understanding of how gparted works I don't see how it couldn't be detected.

Oh well then D

I'm on 13.10. Is there any way to make it so that when I have multiple windows of an application open, and I click the icon to show all the windows, it DOESN'T do the zoom out animation?
But not sure how UEFI interacts with partitions... I will check this out.
benwright, more basic info might be helpful. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2147295
oh geeze, UEFI is a bit beyond me benwright. but the whole partition mapping is different as far as i know. ubuntu can be compatible, it's just a bit more work.. i have a link somewhere
benwright, check here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/UEFI-and-BIOS
Oh yeah this makes sense, windows messed with boot support on the GPT table -_-
benwright, it's not the computers UEFI functionality, but win 8 creating a UEFI partition map/table whichever it's called
Yep, this isn't supported by ubuntu which is why it cannot see the disk.
the partition***
This is going to make it uber painful to install.
benwright, if you prefer the old way, you can apparently get win 8 to install without UEFI, i think it's in that link i put up
benwright, This is an OEM correct?
benwright, sorry not that one. but in this link there is info on getting win 8 to disable uefi  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI

I might just install ubuntu in efi mode
I reinstalled windows on my PC after using linux for 12 years, for the first time the other week.

Hi all.  I have a problem.  I used to be able to open multiple pages, but now it either freezes or closes many times when I open two or more.  Is there a way to fix this?

Ben64 What used to happen, I could open say 5 web pages, and edit, according to reading info off each of them.
Ben64 Now I go to open a second page most times (not always) and the computer freezes, or drops the page altogether.
Hi Every one , Please go through my issue i have explained here http://paste.ubuntu.com/7662154/
Not Showing Dual boot menu after Grub install
Speiros, Have you checked the memory/ram with a test, have you tried this in the guest account and a live environment?
mxvxrts How do I do that mate?
babinlonston, Windows is not in the extended is it?
Speiros, The live has a memory test on the gui you see that has a try or install and memory test.
mxvxrts: While installing Ubuntu i left 26GB Unpartition space in that i have installed windows 7
mxvxrts if it is to test if my ram is getting full, I have nearly a blank memory...nothing on it much at all, except ubuntu itself...almost I mean of course.

babinlonston, You really want that windows at the beginning of the disc as well.
mxvxrts: then how can i fix it now is it possible or only a fresh re-installation will help
Speiros, the live disc you use to install ubuntu with.
Is it possible to do a GUI encrypted installation of ()buntu using multiple disks and custom partition sizes with Trusty?  I did a LVM RAID 5 encrypted install with the 12.04 alternate install iso, but gathered that was no longer necessary to do it the Debian way anymore.
mxvxrts: oh , then will dd command help me to move the partitions ?
mxvxrts Ok, thanks.  I'll test it and come back later.  Thanks for helping mxvxrts and Ben64:)
babinlonston, if you do not have anything important I would install windows first and leave enough space for ubuntu and then install ubuntu
babinlonston, Probably a clone would work, but you have to have room for it to be in a primary partition not a logical inside an extended, or at least the windows boot partition in a primary.
larrypg: already installed and a Developer working in it, so is it possible to fix the issue pls guide
mxvxrts: got it, then every windows installation must be in Primary right for dual boot
babinlonston, basically yes, however if you have the windows boot partition in a primary the OS can be in an extended, I'm not sure I have seen anyone with that set up though, but it will work.
mxvxrts: ok ill try it in other machine first thank you
windows commonly has two partitons one of which is a boot

hi
i just ran df -h and I noticed:: /dev/sda1       909G   15G  848G   2% /
why is my size so large (909gb) but my available is only 848gb
I find it difficult to believe ubuntu takes up almost 60gb
this is without a GUI as well
anyone around?
arog, partition sizes are counted in two ways that is about right.
hey
mxvxrts: so from 900gb almost 50gb gets used up?!
that's crazy!
arog, THat is to full anyway
arog: it probably is reserved space
what do you mean
arog, It is not crazy it is the way it is look it up.
got a link?
im not sure what to search for
arog, The difference is 1000MB for a gig and 1024 for a gig if I have the numbers correct.
arog: by default 5% of a filesystem is reserved for root, 5% of 909G is 45.45G, 45.45+15+848=908.45
mxvxrts: thats not the issue here
Ben64, May not be, however this is true.
right, but irrelevant to the current topic
Ben64, You have not confirmed that well enough to talk that way to me to be honest or at any time. ;)
oh i see Ben64
somebody knows what to do when autotools configure hangs on "checking for tputs in -lncurses"? (ubuntu 13.10)
5% for root wow wonder why it's using that much
mxvxrts: to talk what way? you're giving information that isn't relevant to the issue
arog: it isn't being used, it's just reserved for root. you can change the percentage if you wish
I was going to guess 3gb (thats what google says ubuntu installation is) + maybe 1.5x RAM (I only have 4GB) so total is ~9gb
Ben64: do you know why the reserve is set so high? Is there a performance hit if I lower it?
arog, probably so that if you do hit the limit the system still has enough in reserve to fix things (get rid of things)

adobe does not really support linux flash anymore, have not far awhile

Morning everybody !

mregg You want to create a Bash script that makes a folder with the files date?
Jeroen_Mathon: I want to copy my files into different folders which I would name based on dates. Eg : a file created on 2014-01-23 goes to folder 2014-01, a file created on 2014-03-12 goes to 2014-03, etc.
mregg Did you do some research before you started Writing the bash code?
Jeroen_Mathon: so far I'm trying to experiment with ls -l | awk '{print $5} but I'm not successful
mregg What i thing is that you need these methods: catagorize array(File names) by date,Create folder for Catagories,Put corosponding subitems in their catagorized folders
Those are the methods or functions your program would need.
Youl need to store these variables Array(Catagories),Array(Filenames),string(Date)
You could replace the string with an array. for convinience

When mtab opens partitions in an external Hard-drive, is it normal for the permissions for the partitions to be owned by root?
Youl need to run partitioning software as root
So yes it is normal mikodo :)
At least i hope
mikodo: what format is the partition?
clear
dwa
mikodo: I mean is it FAT32, ext3 etc.?
dwatkins, EXT 4
mikodo: in that case, the mounted partition should have ownership as defined within the partition; you may have to re-chown directories if it's taken from a different system, as the user IDs might not match
but if the files were owned by root originally, that should still be the case now
dwatkins, So, will it be ok to change them to be owned by my user, to not have to use root to use Back in Time?
Backintime uses rsync
It coppies permissions
I'd suggest running any backup script as root anyway.

cfhowlett typed a lot yesterday, it is an uncommon problem I guess
cannot log onto my account, even though the password is correct (via tty)
^ check keyboard layout.. if password contains special chars.. that might* be the reason.
it's not that
or also read that it can be reinstalled in a way that all the apps, docs and bookmarks to remain
can it?
how about resetting root or user's password, tried?

not even that
could, and after changing the account password from within the recovery mode, couldn't

What is the point of downloading the isos via p2p (besides hashing), if one can download from the http mirrors at full speed?
xubuntu438 actually the recommended method is to torrent

Hii all
I am on ubuntu 12.04 lts i am connected to internet via router i wan to access my home pc which is connected to dsl connection how can i
i tried ssh it with here.. i can't do and no ping is coming
you may need to configure port-forwarding, if not.
MayurYa, how to do that
?
MayurYa, thanks i successfully changed the ip using : sudo ifdown --exclude=lo -a && sudo ifup --exclude=lo -a

As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
yey! u nailed it :) so, that bug still exists.. use that workaround ;)
@rahul__ try what Mathisen suggested and do some web search for configuring port-forwarding in your router/modem.
hi
ok MayurYa
hello b
i'm drunk lol
b ask your ubuntu questions
rahul__ if you want to make it simple for you, just find " DMZ host " under nat configuration on the router and type in the ip to your home pc there... This will open ALL ports to that ip... so better to just forward specific ports
@rahul__ DMZ would open your computer to rest of the world, so be wise while using it :wink

How can I denied access to mysql cli command for a user
I think that there are not many solutions
we can chroot that user
don't give them the passwords for the database root user or any databases?
Or use selinux or maybe apparmor
skrrp I say it to my boss
he does not accept
he need only to denied mysql cli for user aptus
so I thought to chroot aptus
using selinux is very complicated
can you not chmod u-x the executable and then add people you want to run it to a group?
sorry
a-x
skrrp please explain
chmod is the command to change file permissions. permissions are read, write, execute (rwx) for user, group, all (uga). if you chmod a-x (all minus execute) then only the owner of the file and groups (ug) will be able to run the file
but in general
the owner of `which mysql`
is root ?
msyql ?
what the deal wth group
i don't know. if you ls -l the file it will tell you user and group owners
=== VASIN_ is now known as knut_2

groups are the middle stage of file permissions. it allows users to be added to a custom group to access shared files

how to set auto change voice device  when i connect blue tooth?
apologies in advance for the wall-o'text. i've got an insidious problem on my hands - my sales team and i (techie) are all running 14.04 with KDE, Thunderbird and Firefox. main application is SugarCRM (web-based). i don't have this problem but my sales team do - every now and again their keyboard stops working. they can't type into emails or Firefox. the only difference is that sales are...
...running the Opacus plugin for Thunderbird and also have JavaScript alert(); s popping up from Sugar for call reminders. a workaround is for them is to click the K menu and type something into the search box, then the keyboard starts to work  again for Thunderbird and Firefox. anyone have any ideas as to a cause or a cure?

Anyone?Or do i just install?
=== WLM|zzzzz is now known as WLM
Or should i wait for 14.04.1?
ronin: I don't believe sendmail accepts input from the command itself. You'd probably have to output to a file then use the file as input when constructing your message.
Hi all, Have a Meridian Explorer DAC. I no longer have any sound. Any known issues with recent updates?
sydney: I'd just go for it. There isn't much point waiting for .1 if you're just going to upgrade to it anyway.

histo, I also have mail
Hi
histo, just trying to put a command to cron and then email the output :)
Does anyone here know how to fix random GPU freezes? (nvidia geforce 710M with the official nvidia drivers)
ronin: cron will email the output unless you have it set not to.
hmm wehre is this configured
ronin: it's part of crontab it will email any output and errors
Or if those GPU freezes can't be fixed, is there a way to make it recover automatically when the GPU is unresponsive?
ronin: set the MAILTO=youremail@test.com  in your crontab
(currently, to recover, I have to press CTRL+AL+F1-F6, then CTRL+ALT+F7, and then everything works again)
ben_g: try not using the nvidia drivers
histo: it was the only way that made my computer use the nvidia graphics card, while not messing up everything
ben_g: what was messed up with the open source drivers?
the open-source drivers only work for my on-board GPU (which is a lot slower than my nvidia card)
And I tried bumblebee once too, but with it, i had no graphics at all
ben_g: ahh you have a dual video card setup... Perhaps try a different version of the driver from nvidia then.
I tried the latest linux one, what version should I use then?
Hey. I'm running 14.05, and I have a monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, however that resolution isn't available in system settings (the max is 1920x1080). Any help would be much appreciated.
hi, am able to login to ubuntu but it shows 4 options including to run with low graphics mode
hi there where can I download an iso image to install trusty tahr onto a macbook?
but when i choose low graphics mode, it shows only commandline
I use driver version 331.38-Linux-x86-64bit
how the heck is the nouveau driver configured? is there not an .rc file or something?
i experimented, and changed to init 1. Then after , I were able to run to init 5 and graphics shown up correctly.
but when the system is rebooted again the error shows up.
how can i verify if this is related to graphics driver.
sj99, the resolution depends on your video card, not the monitor
Is there a way to just update the graphics drivers, instead of going trough the installation procedure again?
ben_g: I don't know perhaps you'd have to ask nvidia for support with 'their' driver.
pavlos: samsung advertises it as 2560x1440 pixel resolution
robotdevil: What do you mean by configured?
Is there a way to write a script to reset it automatically when it's frozen? Maybe that's easier.
ben_g: not quite sure how you'd detect that it's frozen.
sj99, are you running 14.04? what video card do you have? again, the resolution depends on the video card, not the monitor.
ben_g: What desktop environment are you running?
Ubuntu 14.04
LTS
ben_g: it's possible something with X or unity is locking up. You could try a different DE for awhile like xfce, kde, lxde, etc.... and test
Well, I do know that everything I do while it's frozen still has effect, the screen just doesn't show it
Doesn't that mean it's only the GPU that causes problems?
ben_g: how does it know what options to run with if there is no xorg
robotdevil: How do you mean? (sorry, I'm quite bad with linux)

Hi, I've noticed that my machine is not running the latest kernel installed (even after reboot). Any reason why?
pavlos: yep - 14.04. I have intel hd 4000 integrated graphics
Grant_P: well what is installed, what is running, and what did you choose during grub?
How can I set up a different DE (whatever that is) to see if it's causing the problem?
fake
It seems that windows autorecovers from the GPU freezes I described by using TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery).
Is there a linux-alternative for this?
sj99, so you need to go to the Intel site and d/l the driver ... https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads
pavlos: thanks, i've installed it and will reboot now
is ubuntu better than xubuntu?
no its the same but with another DE

=== mikespla_ is now known as mikesplain
Guest7100: install BSD. joking aside there are many small and big things you can do to secure your system. start with sshd_config. move the ssh port to a high number in the user range, disable root login. use nmap to scan your system for open ports (services). disable any you don't need. kill inetd if it's running. kill any insecure ftp programs. you might consider a firewall (shorewall) or...
...selinux. you could opt for just not having ports open rather than firewalls. read up on port knocking if you are truly paranoid

Hello, I am looking for a real time cpu/ram/bandwidth monitor for 6 remote servers that will display on a single web page. Currently I have SSH sessions into my servers with htop and bwm-ng running. Does anyone know a good way to do this via the web? I have tried munin and nagios and I don't believe they really show real time (their real time is 1 min refresh)
Stevie24: you can do multiple patterns
nagios is an industry standard
holstein: I agree, but is there a way to make it work so it shows like 1 second refresh ?
for 6 servers?
If so then Ill head over to #nagios
Stevie24: im just saying, if nagios didnt do what i wanted, id rethink what i want.. probably not necessary to have a 1 second refresh
holstein: servers run development operations and i'd like to be able to spot spikes
=== daniel is now known as Guest10967
holstein: therefore 1 minute refresh won't likely show spikes...
 Stevie24 both grep and sed can use the -e for_pattern  so grep -i -e pattern1 -e pattern2 > somefile  sed -i -e 's/pattern1//g' -e 's/pattern2//g'
Great histo, thank you so much !!

holstein than what to do?

n1n0: what i would do is, remove the offending config from the users /home.. you can literally move *all* the .hidden .config files out of the way
holstein would if i knew how
n1n0: new fresh default config files will be generated, then you can test login, and put back what you want/need
n1n0: if you knew what, friend? what to move? im saying, literally *anything* in the users /home that is a .config.. hidden with a dot
n1n0: you can elaborate as to what destkop you are using, and i could give more direct suggestions for specific hidden directories
n1n0: you can make a new user to move/delete these.. you can use a live CD.. regardless, you should backup your important data.. then, you know that you can do a fresh install and *not* keep the user data in place with the errors, and be ok.. you konw that its not a password problem
is there a way to let rsync only show those files, which will be transfered in a dry run?
helo

I want only those files to be printed, which will be transfered (after application of exclude patterns)
holstein thanx for the long info. some kind of link on how to do it would be very much appreciated
n1n0: with *any* filemanager, friend
marscher: why do you want to do that?
histo, I have a backup, and want only to partially restore it. So I need a "diff" of files first
n1n0: what desktop environment are you using? with more informaiton, i can help you pinpoint what might be more specifically causing the issues.. otherwise, literally anything with a dot in front of it in your users home.. which you can access from any filemanager
a diff of the file list ideally
marscher: diff /directory1 /directory2
histo, does this work recursively and for binary files?!
holstein what is the command line in tty to tell you the desktop environment
?

but holstein, how to reset it from terminal, when cannot even access the terminal (except from the guest acc). you mean from the tty? (for the link you sent)?
13.10 was around for very short, right?
n1n0: the link i gave has only terminal commands listed, friend.. have you opened it? and referenced it?
marscher: using that if a only in results in a directory then it won't recurse further because there is no point. e.g. only in /dir1: somedir   then it won't go into somedir
n1n0: 13.10 *is* still supported, but you can reference the link i gave and see that the EOL is in july.. just next month

so that means the password is ok?
marscher: -u is the key
n1n0: sure.. so run the commands *as* that user
ok
n1n0: though, i personally think your time will be well spent backing up your data with a live CD, and doing a fresh install of 14.04 where you *dont* keep the offending user data in place during install

Hey, I have an Ubuntu live USB booted. I've installed some things and am wondering if I can make a persistant overlay with what I currently have? I googled around, but all I can find is stuff on creating the overlay, not saving current stuff to it. I know there must be some way, but I'm kinda stuck.

hello buddy
anyone here do much with MAAS? I have a fresh install of 14.04 installed as MAAS controller that is being cranky and refuses to load the images. Installed OS, booted up, apt-upgrade, reboot, create MAAS user, login, click download images. Also tried "sudo maas-import-pxe-files" after as a backup and that completes but does not result in the webpage recognizing the images' existence
can't seem to find an answer on the net and hoping someone here knows. using 12.04 google chrome, where are the flash files stored?
Guest19759: it's a boot-time kernel option iirc

Not sure about that.

That users home directory got its own configuration of firefox
Hello all, I'm trying to ssh to account@localhost but keep getting roaming now allowed on server error. I've checked and set the permissions for my account user .ssh directory and the files under there (700 for .ssh and 600 for the contained files) but am having no luck. Anyone with any suggestions?
So no they do not share bookmarks
welly: try:  ssh -vvv account@localhost
morning .. is iptables a 1st match style firewall?
boolean: 1st match?
histo: when a rule is matched, no others are processed
ahh
ActionParsnip: beat me to it :) thanks
boolean: usually traffic will only satisfy one rule, otherwise you should have a deny all rule at the bottom that the rest will hit and be denied
ActionParsnip, got the following: http://pastie.org/9302249 but mainly "Roaming not allowed by server" I suspect is the cause
=== Solution-X|AFK is now known as Solution-X

what does ~ mean in a path
ActoinParsnip: therefore, if I have the following mid way through the chain: ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere, the packet will pass and all other rules ignore, correct?

ActionParsnip, but why would it want a dsa public key when it's already been provided with an rsa public key?
I guess if it wants it, I should give it

sovereignentity: In shell (terminal) or GUI?
ActionParsnip: ugh ... iptables doesnt list which interface ( ipytables -L ) the rules apply thus the all to all was for the local loopback

Guest81914 torrent the ISO with transmission.  make a USB.  install
and READ the eolupgrade link
histo, Jeroen_Mathon yes you were right, but only Full ISO, i tried mini :p
mini does not run live
No synaptic?
dimitry7, 'mini' of any distro doesn't run live, that's the whole purpose of making it 'mini' (only essential components)

varunendra, ooh okay, nice!
varunendra: you may be able to switch to other TTYs...
dimitry7: mini is for a net install typically
I just bought a samsung S24D300 and want to use it as dual screen how do I do this, at the mm
histo, yes, mostly!
moment it's connected through hdmi but no signal from pc
dimitry7: it's 25mb you though it would run live?  well it does technically just without any tools
histo, and for example Ubuntu Remix... I booted with it and it gave me a shell $ instead of the GUI, problably my graphics but I runned it on a Power Edge 2950
paulus68: is it connected to a laptop?
ok,i just installed gnome-fallback,and when i loged in,i only the background loaded.None of the keys i push work,and i cannot log back out. how to fix?
ActionParsnip: desktop
dimitry7: distrowatch.org
paulus68: if you reboot with it attached, is it ok?
paulus68: is the hdmi enabled in bios, if it is controlled there
sydney ctrl alt F6 for a terminal.  sudo reboot
histo, I know it... well I am downloading Ubuntu Server now.
burning indeed...
no that's the problem or do I need to do a shutdown restart
hdmi should be enabled in the bios
paulus68: should is a powerful word
ActionParsnip: true
dimitry7: why are you downloading server?
cfhowlett: ok,i will be right back.
dimitry7: it's not a live security distro
histo, I know, but this server can't read DVDs, and there is no CD for Kali
ActionParsnip: any Idea where to find that option in the bios just to be sure
dimitry7: use usb
histo, it can't boot from USB either :-S
histo, I might try again though... first time it didn't

sydney logout and choose unity.  then login --- test if your system is otherwise installed properly
ActionParsnip: when clicking on detect display it does nothing
histo, ooh very, good, thank you!! Will download one of those :-)
cfhowlett: thats just it,i cannot log out,or do anything.
sydney over my head.  sorry.  ask again in channel - someone with more experience than I should know
Ok,I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu gnome,and i decided to install gnome-fallback.well,when i selected gnome fallback and logged back in,nothing loads except the desktop background.I can do ctrl+alt+f1,but thats it.
sydney: do any of the other sessions work?
sydney: What if you right-click the desktop?
Yes,but i cannot log back out.I Have tried that
i cannot even see the mouse
sydney: do you have auto login enabled?
yes
otherwise this would be easy to fix. ;)
ActionParsnip: when changing the HDMI cable to first screen no signal only DVI cable selected
sydney: sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
sydney: disable the autologin-user
Using that line?
thewres nothing else i have to do?

My Ubuntu hanged on boot for 2 consecutive times this morning (after hitting enter in Ubuntu @ boot menu), with only black screen and pressing caps lock key does not even trigger its light. Is there a way to check the boot details etc. any advice?
Ok,thn what do i do?
latest LTS
user123321: upgraded recently? tried an older kernel?
daftykins, clean install.
daftykins, and, no.
have you upgraded it since said clean install?
About to do a fresh (re) install of Ubuntu but I always seem to forget what the commands were to boot a liveUSB from the grub2 command line, any help?
daftykins, just clean install, didn't do major changes intentionally, other than software update and some software installs.
Check this http://goo.gl/mSs3yj
daftykins, no. I installed the latest version.
user123321: so due to said software update (== upgrade) you may have another kernel on
user123321: either look for another or run memtest i'd say
How do i disable automatic login from ctrl+alt+f7?
ActionParsnip: ?
daftykins, I see. But Ubuntu asks me to update right? hmm.
daftykins, I'd do memtest?
user123321: what do you mean asks you to update?
daftykins, Ubuntu shows "new updates are available"
but you said it's not booting...
daftykins, I make sure things are up to date.
sydney, you could go System settings | users and groups and edit that user NOT to autologin
pavlos: In terminal*
daftykins, It didn't this morning for 2 consecutive times, but I booted successfully after. This is what freaking me out :/
user123321: oh... i misunderstood, by hang you mean it just takes a lot longer
daftykins, I had to turn off manually.
sydney: I told you edi thte lightdm.conf
oh, you got in on the third go? :)
sydney, well, someone said to comment out a line in lightdm.conf
histo: but,what do i type?
user123321: yeah straight to memtest then. i don't diagnose anything until that's clean
sydney: sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and disable the autologin-user
daftykins, Yes, I went to ubuntu recovery, it booted. Then did a restsrt, worked. But I'm scared because I don't know hy it happened, what if it happens again o.O
daftykins, Oh ok.
histo: what do i have to type to tell it to disable it?
histo: im in the editor,but i dont know what to type. :(
sydney, the line "autologin-user=" is just that in my system (no auto login). So I guess just remove the user name in that line
sydney: remove your user name or add a # in the front of that line then save the file
You guys are confusing. i dont see any words on the screen except the editor. is there supposed to be "autologin"somewhere?
i just have the editor,and a white blinking cursor
sounds like you typo'd the file name
sydney, there should be 4 lines ... change the autologin-user=sydney to autologin-user=    save, exit.
There is nothing there.
sydney, does "cat /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf" show any lines? You must exit the editor to run this command.
Are you forgetting that im using ubuntu gnomes login manager? OR IS THERE NO DIFFERENCE?
don't use caps.
sorry,i bumped it.
sydney: if you switched to gdm, you'll need the gdm.conf file
ok
sydney, to see which one you have - "locate lightdm.conf gdm.conf"

So...
eric_tux, have you tried reloading the driver?
paulus68: no need to hound one user
No,that didnt show as anytrhing
varunendra: how to do?
daftykins:not my intention
=== james is now known as Guest12085
eric_tux, just guessing here - the driver should be "psmouse", so the commands should be - "sudo modprobe -rv psmouse" ... then ... "sudo modprobe -v psmouse". The first one will disable it, the 2nd one should re-enable it, hopefully properly.
i wil dink around with it later. :)
daftykins: just trying to find a solution that's all and I think Actionparsnip is old enough to tell me that he can't help me
...How do you remove Ubuntu One (And the service "goodbye" message)??
paulus68: asking a question to the whole channel might be more effective
sydney, travel the /etc/gdm/ path and look for a conf file (in my case I have custom.conf) if you find it, edit using nano and disable the autologin
daftykins: already did that actionparsnip started to reply then left which is not his normal behaviour
hi all.. how do i terminate a program.... i cant shutdown wine
=== james_ is now known as Guest47660
varunendra: nop, kernel does not uses psmouse
eric_tux, how did you check? lsmod?
the first -rv command does nothing
=== Guest5757 is now known as cassio3
then I -v , got insmod psmouse
-rv got rmmod psmouse
so I guess the psmouse wasn't loaded the first time
eric_tux, I would like to see the outputs of (pastebin links of) "xinput" and "lsmod"
I just bought a samsung S24D300 and want to use it as dual screen how do I do this, at the mm
moment it's connected through hdmi but no signal from pc
varunendra: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7664317/
eric_tux, apparently it is "BCM5974". You may try replacing 'psmouse' with 'bcm5974' in the modprobe commands. But I have no experience with it, so can't say if it may cause any troubles forcing you to reboot.
is bcm5974 linked with the wifi card? I think that wifi or network is part of the problem
eric_tux, it is touchpad driver, not wifi
ok fine I'll test next time I have the problem and we append a comment to my bug report
s /we/will/
verunendra thanks
eric_tux, you may also try 'xinput float bcm5974' command combo, which is a bit safer. (xinput float bcm5974.... then .... xinput reattach bcm5974 Virtual core pointer)
ok

On my laptop I have 8Go RAM installed, is it normal to find more than 6Go used reported by top (when this problem arrives), swap is totally free?
